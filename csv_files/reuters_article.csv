https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/was-cop28-really-turning-point-reducing-methane-emissions-2024-02-20/,Was COP28 really a turning point for reducing methane emissions?,By Boris Martor,"February 20, 2024",B,"February 20, 2024 - Methane emissions are a major contributor to global warming. Its reduction commitment is one of the key takeaways from the 28th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28) in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, which took place from 30 November to 13 December 2023 with 50 major oil companies committing to stop any methane leakage by 2030. Although this looks significant it is probably too limited to quickly reduce emissions especially as the oil sector is not the only contributor to methane emissions.Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, second only to CO2 in gas emissions and responsible for 30% of the rise in the earth's surface temperature with a warming potential 84 times greater than CO2. Onshore oil and steam coal are the largest two contributors in the energy sector although we will see that the agriculture industry is highly contributing.Unlike CO2, methane disappears much faster from the atmosphere, within 10/15 years, compared to circa 100 years for CO2. For the International Energy Agency (IEA), reducing methane emissions by 30%/40% by 2030 would help decrease warming by at least 0.12°C by 2050.Advertisement · Scroll to continueThis objective has been adopted through various international agreements, in particular within the derived legislation of the EU. The Global Methane Pledge initiative involves 150 countries pledging to reduce their emissions by 30%, a target that is also adopted by the European Union's Fit for 55 package. Fit for 55 refers to the EU's target of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030.Advertisement · Scroll to continueThe proposed package aims to bring EU legislation in line with the 2030 goal. The package of proposals aims at providing a coherent and balanced framework for reaching the EU's climate objectives, which: ensures a just and socially fair transition; maintains and strengthens innovation and competitiveness of EU industry while ensuring a level playing field vis-à-vis third country economic operators; and underpins the EU's position as leading the way in the global fight against climate change.Advertisement · Scroll to continueIn this context, the EU and its Member States announced €175 million in support of the Methane Finance Sprint to boost methane reduction at the Summit. See European Commission press release, 2 December 2023. These funds will help catalyse efforts from government, industry, and philanthropy to reduce methane emissions across the energy sector, including by enabling the methane data revolution with the use of new satellites.Advertisement · Scroll to continueThis Methane Finance Sprint is the first-ever EU law to curb methane emissions in the energy sector, with world-leading standards for measuring, detecting, and stopping emissions in the EU and globally. Information about Europe initiatives can be found on the following websites: European Green Deal-Consilium , opens new tab (europa.eu), and EC, Energy, Methane emissions , opens new tab .European Green Deal-Consilium , opens new tabEC, Energy, Methane emissions , opens new tabReducing methane emissions is relatively inexpensive in comparison to other actions as according to the IEA, ""only"" $75 billion in global investment would be necessary to reduce CH4 emissions by 90%. In comparison, France would need to invest €60/70 billion annually to mitigate the effects of climate change. LES INCIDENCES ÉCONOMIQUES DE L'ACTION POUR LE CLIMAT Jean Pisani-Ferry et Selma Mahfouz, rapport au Premier Ministre mai 2023.Additionally, the measures that can be implemented are simple, and the solutions are widely supported within civil society in the EU. On 1 December 2023, the UNEP International Methane Emissions Observatory released its first public methane emissions data through its Methane Alert and Response System , opens new tab as another development for effective tracking of emissions and leakage.Methane Alert and Response System , opens new tabIn its 2022 report, the International Methane Emissions Observatory indicated that CH4 emissions are concentrated in three sectors: agriculture, waste and extractive industries. Agriculture and energy are the top two contributors, although waste is not far behind. It is indeed not always known and communicated that farmers and more particularly cow emissions are responsible for a very significant level of methane emissions. This is the reason why New Zealand for instance wanted to introduce a special tax to fight against its methane emissions. Although decisions can be difficult politically concerning the agriculture sector, it is certainly an issue to address through more research and testing on cows' food to reduce rumination and consequently emissions.Concerning the energy sector, this 2022 report recommends that gas companies stop flaring excess gas and commit to storing it for resale. This is certainly something that needs more support and coverage by public and private stakeholders around the globe if one really wishes to meet the international agreements' objectives. Good news is that a large number of tools exist to identify a potential leakage. AI coupled with satellites allows identification of leaks in pipelines, which are responsible for colossal emissions. These new technologies, mastered by French start-up Kayrros, enabled Turkmenistan, for example, to reduce CH4 emissions.A NASA mission is also able to identify the main sources of emissions and leaks to implement a ""Name and Shame"" strategy. In 2024, a new satellite known as MethaneSAT will beam its first megabyte of data to Earth where scientists stand ready with advanced modeling and machine learning to pinpoint and measure emissions from leaking oil and gas production sites worldwide. The question of actioning leakage remediation after identification especially in emerging markets may somewhat be questioned as some national companies do not necessarily care about this in practice.Another growing option is to use methane from waste as a source of energy for industry involving conversion of CH4 from landfills into biogas, electricity or heat for industries — not only limiting direct methane emissions, but also preventing the conversion of flared methane into CO2. Green Tech for Good related start-ups such as Volta GreenTech, a Swedish-based organisation dedicated to methane emissions reduction, should clearly play a role to save our planet from methane.The IMF has also entered the debate, recommending the creation of a methane market with a common market price among states, based on fiscal policies, to protect the competitiveness of developing countries. This shows another way in which governments, international organisations and businesses can implement solutions with impact on global warming.COP28 was critical to address the issue of methane emissions and a slow start was made but is encouraging for our future planet. Coincidentally, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced a final rule that will sharply reduce emissions of methane and other harmful air pollution from oil and natural gas operations which are the largest source of methane pollution in the U.S.This new U.S. rule includes standards to reduce methane and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from new, modified, and reconstructed sources. It also includes Emissions Guidelines for states to follow as they develop plans to limit methane emissions from existing sources.The EPA expects that this rule will avoid an estimated 58 million tons of methane emissions from 2024 to 2038 representing 80 percent less than projected methane emissions without the rule. It should also avoid 16 million tons of smog-forming VOC emissions and 590,000 tons of air toxics. The question will be whether EPA's new rule will be enforced and any deviation actually sanctioned.There are clearly ways to reduce and control methane emissions and COP28 was probably a way to help the U.S. in its mission to reduce methane as the international agreements will favor national actions in North America. With commitments made, it is now a question of supporting convergence, financing technology and tracking deviations. In this respect, the question of international sanctions against entities' violations remains. Environmental violations are rarely sanctioned by international treaties and EU member states will individually need to cascade into their legislations any measures taken internationally so that commitments can be fully respected.Opinions expressed are those of the author.

Too many ill people, not enough resources.Yet extra investment alone will not solve the problem.

She explains that this is due to the diversity of therapy areas and market reach.Respective capacity is also a limiting factor, she adds: “Partly, the reason is (that) every company is at a slightly different point in its technology journey ... so there isn't a universal silver bullet that says ‘this is the digital tool that can be applied’.”White hopes this might change through SMI’s efforts to establish a common framework to calculate emissions linked to patient-care pathways. A preliminary iteration of the protocol, which is being developed in conjunction with the UK’s National Health Service and the British Standards Institute, is expected later this year.Having consistent data will enable the sector’s main players to focus on areas of greatest carbon impact, she explains: “Having an aligned measurement system is really, really key because then we’re going to act on facts (and) do what science expects us to do.”Trade-offs will be inevitable on the road ahead. Immediate health priorities will, presumably, always trump longer-term climate concerns. Take low-carbon asthma inhalers, for example. Inhalers, which are used by 12 million people in the UK, account for 3% of the NHS’s carbon footprint because of the gas propellant inside them.As AstraZeneca concedes in a recent white paper , opens new tab , dry powder inhalers, which are propellant-free, may be less environmentally damaging but they may also not be appropriate for everyone and could therefore lead to “poorer asthma control”.recent white paper , opens new tabSimilarly, many preventative measures lie outside the hands of private healthcare companies, either because they rely on public investment (eg urban parks, cycle paths, etc) or private lifestyle choices (taking regular exercise, maintaining a healthy diet, etc).Yet there are far more synergies between climate change and health than not.

But it presented an opportunity for one man.Elon Musk - the owner of SpaceX, the world's most successful rocket launcher – seized on the failure to prevail over state-owned China Great Wall Industry Corp (CGWIC) as Jakarta's company of choice for putting satellites into space.The Chinese contractor had courted Indonesia - Southeast Asia's largest economy and a key space growth market - with cheap financing, promises of broad support for its space ambitions and the geopolitical heft of Beijing.A senior government official and two industry officials in Jakarta familiar with the matter told Reuters the malfunction marked a turning point for Indonesia to move away from Chinese space contractors in favour of companies owned by Musk.Advertisement · Scroll to continueNusantara-2 was the second satellite launch awarded by Indonesia to CGWIC, matching the two carried out by SpaceX at that time. Since its failure, SpaceX has launched two Indonesian satellites, with a third set for Tuesday; China has handled none.SpaceX edged out Beijing through a combination of launch reliability, cheaper reusable rockets, and the personal relationship Musk nurtured with Indonesian President Joko Widodo, Reuters found. Following a meeting between the two men in Texas in 2022, SpaceX also won regulatory approval for its Starlink satellite internet service.Advertisement · Scroll to continueThe SpaceX deals mark a rare instance of a Western company making inroads in Indonesia, whose telecommunications sector is dominated by Chinese companies that offer low costs and easy financing.

Some of them spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorised to talk to media.Advertisement · Scroll to continue""SpaceX has never failed in launching our satellites,"" said Sri Sanggrama Aradea, head of the satellite infrastructure division at BAKTI, an Indonesian communications ministry agency.The April 2020 incident makes it ""hard"" for Jakarta to turn to CGWIC again, he added.SpaceX, CGWIC and Pasifik Satelit Nusantara - a key shareholder in the Nusantara-2 project - did not respond to questions for this story.Advertisement · Scroll to continueChina's Foreign Ministry said in response to Reuters questions that ""Chinese aerospace enterprises are continuing their space cooperation with Indonesia in various forms."" It did not elaborate.Presidential office spokesperson Ari Dwipayana said the government prioritises efficient and capable technology that meets the need of Indonesians when awarding contracts.The tussle between SpaceX and China offers a window into a much larger battle to dominate a rapidly expanding space industry.The global satellite market - including manufacturing, services and launches - was worth $281 billion in 2022, or 73% of all space business, according to U.S. consultancy BryceTech.SPACE RACEChina launched a record 67 rockets last year, out of 223 globally, according to a report by Harvard professor and orbital tracker Jonathan McDowell. The vast majority were launched by CGWIC.That put China only behind the United States, which had 109 launches, 90% of which were done by SpaceX, the report found.Washington and Beijing are also competing over satellite-based communications networks.SpaceX's Starlink, which owns around 60% of the roughly 7,500 satellites orbiting earth, is dominant in the satellite internet sphere. But, last year, China began launching satellites for its rival Guowang broadband mega-constellation.U.S. military officials have said China wants to use satellites and space technology to spy on rivals and increase military capabilities.China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement to Reuters the U.S. allegations were a smear and that Washington was using the concerns as a pretext to expand its influence in space.Unlike its Chinese counterpart, NASA relies primarily on privately owned rockets from firms such as SpaceX, which has billions of dollars in U.S. government contracts.But the U.S. government and military are concerned about their reliance on SpaceX, especially given Musk's muscular business style, according to one current and one former U.S. official working on space policy.While legacy U.S. defence contractors like Boeing (BA.N) , opens new tab and Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) , opens new tab typically consult the State Department before making foreign deals, Musk and SpaceX dealt directly with Jakarta, the two officials said.(BA.N) , opens new tab(LMT.N) , opens new tabIn response to Reuters' questions, a Lockheed Martin spokesperson said the company ""works closely with the U.S. Government, our allied nations and international customers"".

It's difficult to break China's dominance.""STARBASE MEETINGIn May 2022, Jokowi, as the powerful Indonesian president is popularly known, visited a SpaceX facility in Boca Chica, Texas.""Welcome to Starbase,"" Musk said, smiling and shaking hands with the president, who was seeking Tesla investment in Indonesia's nickel sector.Widodo's two-hour visit included 30 minutes of talks with Musk at an office packed with miniature rockets and then a tour of the production area, according to an Indonesian official with direct knowledge.The president has long sought to build an EV industry in Indonesia, which has the world's biggest reserves of nickel, a key element in electric batteries.

That gave the impression the West was militarily weak – and may have encouraged Russian President Vladimir Putin to think he would face little opposition after invading Ukraine.Biden has also presided over the start of a technological cold war with China. Meanwhile, the protectionist elements of his Inflation Reduction Act, a plan to boost green industry and manufacturing at home, has caused trade friction with allies. More recently, the U.S. president has so far failed to advance his plan to make peace between Israel and the Palestinians.Advertisement · Scroll to continueTHE ROSY OUTCOMEThere are, though, reasons to hope a second administration would do better. A re-elected Biden would certainly enjoy a honeymoon period with allies.

He says that the United States should recognise it needs more friends, especially in the developing world, and that reaching mainly for sticks such as sanctions isn’t winning their support.returnSingh argues Biden should articulate a new joined-up doctrine of economic statecraft early in a second term. Singh would like to give more emphasis to carrots – such as a $600 billion plan by the Group of Seven rich democracies to help poor countries build sustainable infrastructure.$600 billion planHURDLES AND HEADWINDSThere are many obstacles to realising such a rosy scenario. For a start, even if Biden wins a second term, he may not control Congress. That would limit his ability to do anything that requires large amounts of money. The poor state of U.S. public finances will further inhibit spending.Fortunately, there are creative ways to fund some policy objectives without hurting the U.S. government’s finances much. For example, Washington could provide loans to Kyiv backed by Ukraine’s claims against Russia for war damages. It could also use guarantees to incentivise the private sector to fund green projects in developing countries – though the Atlantic Council’s Hung Tran points out that Congress still has to approve every guarantee.war damagesMeanwhile, there’s one way to raise money while fighting global warming: to put a formal price on carbon emissions, something the EU and other jurisdictions already do. If that’s politically impossible, Biden has a fiscally neutral alternative: he could tighten regulations against pollution, based on an estimated shadow price for carbon that his administration recently hiked , opens new tab to $190 from $51 a tonne.carbon emissionshiked , opens new tabOf course, Biden’s ability to defuse global tension also relies on what other countries do. Putin, for example, may keep fighting in Ukraine. And Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may keep saying “no” to giving Palestinians their own country.But Russia itself may tire of fighting if the U.S.-led alliance maintains its support for Ukraine. Meanwhile, Israel may find it hard to resist sustained U.S. pressure over several years, especially if Netanyahu fails to cling on as prime minister.The era of superpower rivalry between the United States and China is not over – and the rules-based world order will remain under stress for the foreseeable future. But a second Biden victory would raise hopes for a period with less global tension.stressFollow @Hugodixon , opens new tab on X@Hugodixon , opens new tabEditing by Peter Thal Larsen and Oliver TaslicOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabOpinions expressed are those of the author.

Over the past decade and a half, many companies across the developed world have tried and failed to disrupt retail banking. Mobile phone operators, utilities, and retailers – including Tesco’s UK rival J Sainsbury (SBRY.L) , opens new tab – have sought to muscle in on an industry notorious for inefficiency, lack of innovation, and indifferent customer service. More recently, digital startups like Britain’s Monzo and Germany’s N26 lured customers with whizzy websites and superior smartphone apps. Yet big retail banks have proved remarkably resilient.

The 2008 crisis spawned new rules requiring banks to maintain bigger buffers of capital and liquidity.

Tesco Bank had roughly three times as much capital in 2023 as in 2010.

https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/mass-tort-attorneys-must-ensure-compliance-with-new-aba-guidance-2024-02-16/,Mass tort attorneys must ensure compliance with new ABA guidance,By Jessie Hoerman,"February 16, 2024",J,"CompaniesSimplyConvert LLCSimplyConvert LLCFollowFebruary 16, 2024 - True to their name, mass torts involve thousands, sometimes hundreds of thousands, of claims, myriad data points, and numerous steps from intake to resolution. The management of such legal endeavors requires nonlawyer staff and solutions capable of organizing, analyzing, and securely maintaining vast amounts of client information.In mass torts and class actions, it is common to delegate initial client intake to nonlawyers, whether that is support staff or technology platforms. When delegating tasks in that way, it is imperative that mass tort attorneys comply with all relevant ethical rules, opinions and laws, including the recent guidance from the American Bar Association (ABA).The ABA's recently released Formal Opinion 506 , opens new tab addresses a lawyer's ethical obligations when delegating specific prospective client intake tasks to a nonlawyer. The guidance stated that lawyers are allowed to train and oversee nonlawyers to assist with initial client intake tasks, provided they fulfill their obligations for the management and supervision of nonlawyers following ABA Model Rule 5.3, which covers the responsibilities associated with nonlawyer assistance.Formal Opinion 506 , opens new tabAdvertisement · Scroll to continueThe opinion delves into the ethical responsibilities associated with delegating specific client-intake tasks to nonlawyer assistants, setting a framework for best practices in client representation, and what to look for in a vendor tasked with client intake.For mass tort attorneys seeking to retain clients and avoid potential legal pitfalls, a comprehensive understanding of Formal Opinion 506 is crucial. In order to remain in compliance with this guidance, there are a few crucial steps mass torts attorneys must take.Advertisement · Scroll to continueImplement proper policies, training, and supervision of staffDelegating prospective client intake tasks to nonlawyer assistants, whether that is staff or technology, requires establishing clear and comprehensive policies within a law firm. These policies should outline the specific tasks that can be delegated, emphasizing the importance of following ethical standards.Training should be designed to instruct nonlawyer staff on the ethical aspects of their responsibilities and ensure they have a comprehensive understanding of the limitations imposed by ABA Model Rule 5.3 and Formal Opinion 506.Advertisement · Scroll to continueFor example, Formal Opinion 506 states, ""trained intake personnel may check for conflicts of interest, collect basic information from prospective plaintiffs or class members for lawyers to ascertain their eligibility to make a claim, and explain how fees and costs are charged in such cases."" But as detailed below, there are certain questions to which only a lawyer can respond.Continuous supervision is important to monitor the performance of nonlawyer assistants and address any issues promptly, maintaining the integrity of client interactions.Advertisement · Scroll to continueAt intake, always provide the option for a potential client to speak with the attorney handling their caseConfirming that prospective clients have the opportunity to communicate directly with the attorney who will be handling the case is fundamental to adhering to Formal Opinion 506. Lawyers must take steps to guarantee that prospective clients have the opportunity to discuss fee agreements and the scope of representation with the specific lawyer that would be representing them, prior to signing an engagement letter — not just an attorney employed by an intake center or marketing firm.Additionally, the Opinion discusses the application of Model Rule 5.5 , opens new tab , which determines whether nonlawyers can answer specific legal questions based on jurisdictional definitions. As the Opinion states, ""If the prospective client asks about what legal services the client should obtain from the lawyer, wants to negotiate the fees or expenses, or asks for interpretation of the engagement agreement, the lawyer is required to respond to ensure that the non-lawyer does not engage in the unauthorized practice of law…""Model Rule 5.5 , opens new tabTherefore, the intake process should be designed to facilitate attorney-client communication, allowing clients to discuss their matters, ask questions, and seek clarification on legal aspects, fees, the scope of representation, and objectives. In offering this option, attorneys not only comply with this new guidance but also create transparency and trust in the attorney-client relationship.Avoid conflicts of interest at the outset of a client relationshipAt the beginning of any client intake, attorneys need to perform a conflict check before agreeing to accept a new client. Firms should disclose to potential clients that the client-attorney relationship is not established until the firm has completed a conflict check and confirmed that they can assist the potential client.Nonlawyers can perform an initial screening of prospective clients by checking for conflicts of interest, utilizing website intake questions, and employing conflict-checking algorithms. By checking for conflicts at the outset, law firms can ethically represent the prospective client without fear of conflicting with existing clients or other obligations.Note all communications coming from nonlawyer personnel as such and provide attorney contact informationIn the client-attorney relationship, it's best practice to uphold transparency and prevent any confusion. All communication initiated by nonlawyer personnel should be identified as such, including emails or other written correspondence. Clients should be made aware of the roles of nonlawyer assistants and provided with clear contact information for the supervising attorney.Ensuring compliance with ABA guidelines at every stage of client intake is crucial, especially for mass tort attorneys who are often representing thousands of plaintiffs. By performing the necessary work at the beginning of a client relationship, firms can avoid ethical pitfalls and focus on their important work seeking justice for their clients.Opinions expressed are those of the author.

They worried about side effects such as nausea, vomiting and other gastrointestinal problems, as well as potential unknown risks from long-term use.Novo’s clinical trial of Wegovy in adolescents lasted about 18 months.Their son, Billy Small III, was 5-foot-9 (1.75 meters) and weighed 385 pounds (176 kilograms) at the time. Their pediatrician warned that he was at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease. He had already been diagnosed with asthma.""We asked Billy how he felt about it. He just really wanted the weight to be gone,"" said his father.Since starting on Wegovy in March 2023, Billy has lost about 90 pounds, or 23% of his total body weight. The drug was covered by the family’s state Medicaid plan.Billy’s appetite diminished sharply, and he rarely experienced side effects. He started to join friends for movies and basketball games and began going to the gym with his father.""The weight was hard on his confidence,"" Billy Small Jr. said of his son, now 16. ""His quality of life is already 100 times better than what it was.""Both Novo and Eli Lilly are testing their weight-loss drugs in children as young as 6. Lilly's drug, tirzepatide, is only approved for adults in the U.S. under the brand name Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss.Lilly said it couldn’t comment on ""future plans for tirzepatide in children or adolescents as clinical trials are still ongoing.""Novo said there are about 175 million children and adolescents with obesity worldwide, and for some, a reduced-calorie diet and increased exercise may not be enough.GLOBAL EPIDEMICThe U.S. is among a handful of countries trying new weight-loss drugs in youth. Any lessons learned could inform health officials elsewhere. Novo said the drug received similar approvals for youth last year in Germany, the UK, Denmark and the United Arab Emirates.Without insurance coverage, Wegovy can cost as much as $1,300 per month in the U.S. Data so far show a majority of people who stop taking it regain much of the lost weight. It is not clear whether there are ways to avoid using it for a lifetime.Komodo reviewed health insurance claims involving nearly 20 million children, or about 80% of the U.S. population aged 12 to 17. Among these patients, 2.25 million adolescents had an obesity diagnosis listed in their insurance claims during the nearly six-year period reviewed. The analysis was conducted using closed insurance claims through October 2023.Reuters GraphicsSome medical experts urge caution given a lack of evidence about how these medications may affect development.The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended intensive counseling, including behavioral therapy and nutritional education, rather than medication, for helping children who need to lose weight.""We don't really know what these medications do in the context of the growing child,"" said Dr. Dan Cooper, distinguished professor of pediatrics at the University of California at Irvine.Reporting by Robin Respaut in Oakland and Chad Terhune in Los Angeles Editing by Michele Gershberg and Bill BerkrotOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabPurchase Licensing Rights"

But with a still-tight labor market continuing to churn out jobs at a strong clip and wage growth remaining elevated, consumer spending is far from collapsing. That should sustain the economic expansion.""Retail sales in January declined sharply, however, revised seasonal factors and inclement weather exaggerated the degree of the slowing in spending following the holiday spending spree,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide.Retail sales tumbled 0.8% last month, the biggest drop since March 2023, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau said. Data for December was revised lower to show sales rising 0.4% instead of 0.6% as previously reported. November sales were also revised down to show them unchanged, rather than rising 0.3%.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales dipping 0.1% in January.Reuters GraphicsRetail sales are mostly goods and are not adjusted for inflation.

Seasonal factors, the model that the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data, expected a smaller drop in sales this January compared to previous years. The decline was larger than had been anticipated by the seasonal factors, resulting in the bigger drop in adjusted sales last month.Economic data is generally difficult to seasonally adjust at the start of the year, a process that has also been made difficult by distortions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.Advertisement · Scroll to continueThe weather impact was evident in the 4.1% plunge in building material and garden equipment store sales. Receipts at motor vehicles and parts dealers also tumbled 1.7%. Snow storms blanketed large swathes of the country in January. The other major drag on sales came from a 1.7% drop in gasoline station receipts, reflecting lower prices at the pump.Freezing temperatures also slammed production at factories last month, with output falling 0.5%, a separate report from the Federal Reserve showed on Thursday.

There were decreases in sales at electronics and appliance outlets as well as clothing, health and personal care, and sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. But sales at food services and drinking places, the only services component in the report, increased 0.7%.Economists view dining out as a key indicator of household finances. Furniture stores receipts surged 1.5%.Though momentum is slowing, consumer spending remains healthy, thanks to the resilient labor market and rising household purchasing power as inflation subsides.A fourth report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 212,000 for the week ended Feb. 10.Reuters GraphicsClaims are bouncing around low levels despite a recent rush of high-profile layoffs, mostly in the technology and media sectors.

""Real disposable incomes are growing at a decent pace, and we see little reason to expect a surge in household saving because balance sheets are solid and rising house prices and equity markets are adding to net wealth.""Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services decreased 0.4% in January.

The unionized Detroit automakers trail far behind, with EVs accounting for only 4% of Ford’s total sales and 3% of GM deliveries.Stellantis plans to launch eight battery-electric vehicles in the U.S. by the end of 2024, including an all-electric Ram pickup and two Jeep EVs.The problem for Detroit brands in meeting Biden’s proposed emissions curbs is their outsized reliance on their largest and least efficient vehicles: mid- and full-sized pickups and truck-based SUVs. Such vehicles account for 46% of GM’s sales and 59% percent of those at Ford, a Reuters review of their 2023 sales by model shows.Those figures do not include the automakers’ smaller, car-based crossover SUVs. The Ram and Jeep brands exclusively sell pickups and SUVs and accounted for 77% of Stellantis' U.S. sales last year.Reuters GraphicsINCENTIVE TO POLLUTEAs Detroit pushes back, environmental groups are countering that a climate emergency demands an even stricter mandate for all-electric fleets by 2035.The Biden administration regulations, if enacted, would mark an abrupt and painful change for Detroit after years of regulations that have incentivized the automakers’ focus on trucks and SUVs by giving these models easier emissions targets to meet.The rules enabled automakers to build more of the large, heavy, powerful vehicles many U.S. customers wanted and would pay premium prices to own.All told, pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles, and car-based crossovers accounted for 79% of light vehicle sales in the U.S. market last year. In 1975, 80% of vehicles sold in the United States were sedans, according to the EPA.The agency, in a statement to Reuters, said the average fuel economy of all U.S. vehicles would be 18% higher than the 26 mpg 2022 average if the fleet had the same ratio of cars to trucks as it had 50 years ago.Gasoline engines today are far more efficient than those of the 1970s. But automakers have used efficiency gains to provide customers more horsepower or larger vehicles, EPA data show.Detroit’s automakers now have the lowest average fuel economy among 14 major manufacturers in the U.S. market. All three fall short of the industry average 26.9 MPG the EPA projects for 2023 models.“Improvements to gasoline power technology have been wasted on moving to larger and more powerful vehicles,” said David Cooke of the environmental group Union of Concerned Scientists.TOUGH ROAD AHEADBiden’s proposals could require the Detroit automakers to undertake extensive product or technological overhauls to comply.GM had eschewed hybrids for the U.S. market as a waste of resources. In February, however, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said GM is now working on plug-in hybrids for the U.S. market in response to rising sales of hybrids.Both Ford and GM have struggled to sell their full-sized EV pickups.

Israelis stopped spending and travelling, hundreds of thousands were called up into reserve military duty in one of the largest troop mobilizations Israel has ever seen and thousands of Palestinian workers were laid off.Preliminary data on economic activity in the fourth quarter are due on Monday at 1 pm (1100 GMT) and economists expect a double digit contraction due to declines in consumer spending, investment in areas such as construction - where half of building sites are idle since the government has not yet allowed the return of Palestinian workers - and in service exports.Consumer confidence stands at levels not seen since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, while the annual inflation rate has eased back down to 3%, prompting a Bank of Israel rate reduction of a quarter-point in January.Advertisement · Scroll to continueAt the outset of the war, most private spending was just on essential goods like food, while Israelis were not in any mood to travel for leisure, or go to movies or shows.Now, even as fighting continues in Gaza, thousands of reservists have been sent home and crowds have returned to the shopping malls and restaurants that were shut down at the start of the war.""It seems like the economy is coming back,"" said Bank Leumi chief economist Gil Bufman. He pointed to real-time data such as credit card purchases that indicate ""demand is coming back"" following a ""terrible month"" in October, before stabilizing in November and improving in December.Advertisement · Scroll to continue'ECONOMY IS RESILIENT'Economic growth in 2023 is estimated at around 2% with projections for 2024 between 0.5% and 2% - helped by high state spending - before expanding more rapidly in 2025.The slowdown in 2023 that came amid a global downturn followed robust post-pandemic economic growth of 9.3% in 2021 and 6.5% in 2022. The expansion was led by the high-tech sector that accounts for 17% of economic output, 12% of jobs and 56% of exports.Advertisement · Scroll to continue""We did not encounter a fundamental problem in the economy. To the contrary. The economy is resilient,"" Avi Simhon, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's chief economic adviser, told Reuters. He cited stronger than expected tax income in January that helped lead to a monthly budget surplus.Avi SimhonRatings agency Moody's last week downgraded Israel's credit rating to A2 from A1 due to elevated political risks and weaker public finances stemming from the war. But, it noted, the economy itself ""has managed the fall-out from the conflict reasonably well"" with some indicators pointing to a swift rebound and the labour force is approaching pre-war levels.Advertisement · Scroll to continueIt cautioned, though, that should the conflict spread to include Hezbollah in Lebanon - where both sides trade cross-border fire daily - the ""negative economic impact would spread to more sectors and be longer-lasting.""If the war remains contained, and ends soon, a sharp rebound is forecast for 2025. Bufman sees a 5.5% expansion while the central bank projects 5%.""The Israeli economy is rooted on strong and healthy economic fundamentals, and is a world leader in the fields of innovation and technology,"" said Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron this week.He said economic rebounds had followed the Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s, the second Lebanon war in 2006 and conflicts with Hamas militants in Gaza in 2008, 2012, 2014 and 2021.This, Leumi's Bufman said, is because growth drivers remain - including rapid population growth of 2% a year, Israel's natural gas production, high levels of research and development and a highly skilled workforce able to work from home and bolster the services sector.""We went through a very difficult period in the fourth quarter with all the things that happened, but it does seem like things are coming back,"" Bufman said.Reporting by Steven Scheer, Editing by William MacleanOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabPurchase Licensing Rights"

Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.The new sanctions would come as the U.S. and its allies look to maintain pressure on Russia with U.S. military aid to Ukraine increasingly in doubt.

Annual revenue rose 200% between 2009 and 2012; by the end of 2019, the group had reaped a roughly $500 million profit. Others fizzle.

Now that interest rates are higher, heavily leveraged infrastructure faces a less hospitable environment. Meanwhile, inflation is falling, stemming price increases on tolls and other contractually controlled revenue sources. And rising yields on super-safe assets like U.S. Treasury bonds mean infrastructure may be held to a higher bar on returns.This is the flip side of the dependability of what industry insiders call “core” infrastructure: its inflexibility. For a fixed asset like a road, there are fewer operational tricks for owners to resort to when things go south.That collides with new challenges.

While private valuations kept climbing – Blackstone (BX.N) , opens new tab , Carlyle (CG.O) , opens new tab and KKR (KKR.N) , opens new tab marked up their portfolios between 8% and 18% last year – listed infrastructure companies like telecoms operators or energy producers now trade at a valuation discount to the broader market, notes Cohen & Steers.

More patient demand in turn drives up emissions.The sector’s footprint sprawls across energy, agriculture, pharmaceuticals and transport, and to make inroads shrinking it, environmental sustainability is going to have to be a question for everyone from caregivers to procurement executives.Advertisement · Scroll to continueAs the NHS discovered, no stone can be left unturned – from phasing out anaesthetics with high global-warming potential and employing re-usable gowns and scrubs to reducing the carbon intensity of medicines, cutting waste and persuading surgeons to cycle to work.The NHS told its 80,000 suppliers that by 2030, it would no longer purchase from any of them if they were not also travelling towards net zero by 2045 or sooner. A powerful incentive then. But for those suppliers that means getting the data to make the decisions that will drive progress in their own supply chains.Advertisement · Scroll to continueKatrine DiBona, corporate vice president, global public affairs and sustainability at Danish healthcare group Novo Nordisk, described the challenge on a panel at COP28: “It’s a daunting task,” she said. “The trick is figuring out where's the most bang for the buck – where we can help leverage new technology to do big jumps instead of marginal jumps.”A Novo Nordisk employee controls a machine at an insulin production line in a plant in Kalundborg, Denmark. REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tabPurchase Licensing Rights , opens new tabDavid Croft, global sustainability director at health and hygiene group Reckitt, says the company had been making good progress on relative emissions, which measure emissions per unit of production. While these might fall, absolute emissions can increase if a company grows.Advertisement · Scroll to continue“Relative carbon emissions just doesn't cut it. We understood … you've got to start pulling back the absolute. That was the step-change for us.”And like many other companies the challenge is getting actual data, not relying on modelling. That includes on the impact of its raw materials, where it’s working as part of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD).On carbon, Reckitt is working with CO2AI, a startup within the Boston Consulting Group, to analyse the value chain. “We can look not just where the biggest footprint is, but where the cross-category links are. If, like us, you have a broad portfolio, you have to think horizontally: which are the biggest ingredients, not just how do I deal with one product. That's where economies of scale kick in … and where you can make the fastest progress.”Advertisement · Scroll to continueMany companies in the sector share suppliers, so collaboration is a key route to deliver impact. The Manufacture 2030 platform , opens new tab , used extensively in the automotive and grocery industries, is also enabling companies in healthcare to collect supplier data. “We want the supplier to take action, we don’t want them to spend endless hours submitting data,” says Giulia Usai, senior director global procurement sustainability at pharma giant GSK. Sometimes, she adds, suppliers will need help building capacity, as they may not be large enough to have a sustainability team in place.Manufacture 2030 platform , opens new tabGSK is working through the same platform with AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Sanofi to tackle the carbon footprint of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). These are the key constituents of medicines and are resource-intensive because their manufacture requires heat, and their chemical building blocks have fossil origins. Moreover, many of them are manufactured in India and China, where the grid is more carbon-intensive than in Europe.A man clears bags filled with medical waste at a hospital in Mumbai, India. REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tabPurchase Licensing Rights , opens new tabSome of these companies also work together as part of the Sustainable Markets Initiative Health Systems Taskforce and have agreed joint minimum climate and sustainability targets for their suppliers.These include setting near-term science-based targets, addressing water and waste, and committing to switch to renewable power. Those efforts combined could tackle over 3 million metric tons of global warming gases.The Health Systems Taskforce is also working with NHS England to develop a sector-wide standard for developing medicines’ life cycle assessment (LCA), and a framework to identify the major drivers of emissions in different healthcare delivery pathways. Another strand aims to quantify carbon emissions of clinical trials.Having a standardised means of calculating emissions across products would drive ambition and competition, suggests Novo Nordisk’s DiBona.“Imagine if on each medical product, you have the LCA on emissions and plastics, for example,” she said at COP28. “Then you can compare it and then suddenly you also have the consumer or the patient perspective, they can also compare it. I think really pressuring us and driving that competition is going to be key.”There might have to be trade-offs in different parts of the life cycle. Reckitt has been using what it calls a sustainable innovation calculator as it develops new products. “It's not a full-blown life cycle analysis, it’s a proxy, and it gives us a real sense of the footprint for the total life cycle of the product: the water footprint, the packaging footprint and the chemical footprint,” explains Croft.To count as sustainable, a new product must score at least 10 points more than whatever it is replacing. “As time goes on, there's going to be a law of diminishing returns, you won't always be able to get 10 points better.” But it will have more measured data, which will be critical at early stages of innovation. “If the key focus is on carbon, does that mean we trade off on plastics? No, not below a certain level. Tensions will inevitably exist.”The most obvious place to begin the decarbonisation journey is swapping out fossil fuels for renewables. But renewables aren’t readily available everywhere, and there may be financial barriers for suppliers.A worker drives a forklift at a large airline pharmaceutical cold storage facility. REUTERS/Rachel Wisniewski Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tabPurchase Licensing Rights , opens new tabSo the pharma sector is working to facilitate power purchase agreements, which bring additional renewables onto the grid. That’s especially critical in India and China which are reckoned to account for 50% of medicines materials production. In January, AstraZeneca, Lonza, Novartis, Novo Nordisk and Roche agreed a power purchase agreement (PPA) that will deliver 200 gigawatt hours (GWh) of renewables annually, for their suppliers across four cities in China.“When you sign a PPA, there is a minimum volume requirement and good credit rating (required), so we knew that it was going to be a barrier for (some of) our suppliers,” says GSK’s Usai. Many of GSK’s ingredient suppliers are in India, and it’s identified five states where she’s optimistic of making progress on contracts this year.In a separate initiative, Energize, a joint initiative between the pharmaceutical sector and Schneider Electric, has formed five cohorts of buyers in North America, the UK and EU that have a combined electricity demand of 2 terawatt hours (TWh).Reckitt is beginning to ask suppliers about the footprint of an ingredient from an individual factory site. That’s critical, says Croft. “We're also asking: what is your programme for decarbonising and …, progressively, that becomes a dialogue that's also asking about the resilience of that supply chain.”That means questions about water supply, to ensure manufacturing can continue, and hot on its heels will come the same conversation about carbon, he adds. “Resilience on carbon comes to pricing and can that supplier work really well in a low-carbon economic environment? That’s what we're ramping up to 2024.”Decarbonising healthcare is a massive cross-sectoral challenge. But making progress will touch all our lives for the better.This article is part of the latest issue of The Ethical Corporation magazine, on the Health-Climate nexus.

And here’s where different markets have widely diverging views. Investors betting on interest rates have a bleaker view of the economic trajectory. They think the Fed will cut borrowing costs aggressively by the end of the year. Derivatives prices collected by LSEG imply an 80% probability that the Fed will lower rates four times by December, and a near-50% chance it will cut five times. Looking further out, derivatives markets are pricing in nearly 175 basis points of rate cuts between May this year and June 2025. Since 1955, a monetary policy easing of that magnitude has only ever occurred because of a recession, according to Jim Reid at Deutsche Bank. The exception came in 1984-1985 when Fed Chair Paul Volcker reversed previous steep rate hikes as inflation eased.Advertisement · Scroll to continueReuters GraphicsThis gloomy outlook is entirely missing from equity markets. In fact, Wall Street analysts forecast that earnings per share at S&P 500 companies will grow 10% this year and 13% in 2025. Economic data also point to a “soft landing”, with inflation abating and the economy avoiding a contraction. GDP is on track to rise at an annual rate of 3.4% in the first quarter of the year, according , opens new tab to the Atlanta Fed, while unemployment has been below 4% for two years – the longest such stretch in more than half a century.according , opens new tabbelowAdvertisement · Scroll to continueFed Chair Jerome Powell will not be easing monetary policy so quickly if the economy remains resilient, not least because every Fed decision until November’s U.S. presidential election will come under heavy scrutiny from both Democrats and Republicans. Powell recently stressed the Fed would be “prudent” in lowering rates even though inflation is converging towards its 2% target.stressedHow to explain the discrepancy? One possibility is a glitch in the Fed funds futures market, which anticipate the central bank’s moves. The contracts, traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, are used by banks and companies to hedge interest rate risk and by speculators to bet on rate movements. As such, they are an expression of market participants’ views, not a perfect crystal ball. Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management (APO.N) , opens new tab , has noted , opens new tab that derivatives tend to overestimate the central bank’s willingness to cut when rates are high, and vice-versa.

Yields on 2-year U.S. Treasury bonds have risen from 4.19% on Feb. 1 to 4.49% on Feb. 12, as strong data and Powell’s cautious words convinced traders that rates would remain high.Reuters GraphicsThat matters for the equity market because bonds compete with shares for investors’ affections. High stock valuations and rising yields have pushed the equity risk premium – the excess return that stock market investors expect over risk-free U.S. government debt – to its lowest level since at least 2006, according to Michael Hunstad, deputy chief investment officer at Northern Trust Asset Management. History suggests that slow rate cuts as inflation glides back to target are better for equity investors than fast monetary easing caused by a looming recession. In cycles where the Fed has cut rates less than five times in 12 months, the S&P 500 has risen on average 24% in the first year, according to Ned Davis Research. By contrast, stocks only rose by an average of 5% in the first year of quick cuts. During the last two big recessions, in 2001 and 2007, the S&P 500 ended up losing 14% and 21%, respectively, within a year of the first rate cut.The wild card this time is Big Tech. The seven giants make up nearly 30% of the S&P 500’s total market capitalisation and 22% of its members’ total expected net income for 2024. Continued strong performance would keep pushing up the whole market. Recent signs are positive. Five of the six that have already reported earnings for last quarter of 2023 beat Wall Street’s earnings estimates. David Kostin of Goldman Sachs reckons that if Nvidia meets consensus forecasts when it reports later this month, the Magnificent Seven will deliver a 14% year-on-year increase in revenues, way better than the 2% managed by the other S&P 500 stocks to have reported so far.Of course, the Magnificent Seven wouldn’t be immune to a sharp economic downturn. Investors cannot be right about both the direction of U.S. interest rates and the future of U.S. stocks. If traders need a reason to be cheerful, they may have to turn away from Washington and look in the direction of Silicon Valley.Editing by Peter Thal Larsen, Aditya Sriwatsav and Streisand NetoOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabOpinions expressed are those of the author.

Buckland thought it was a lizard about 66 feet (20 meters) long, walked on four legs and could live on land or in the water.

Scientists now know Earth is about 4.5 billion years old. Megalosaurus lived about 165 million years ago.""It took several decades for geologists to understand that the Earth was truly old, and that life has evolved over vast stretches of time.

Beginning around the 1870s, the first complete large dinosaur skeletons - first in the American West, then in Belgium and elsewhere - demonstrated the distinctive anatomy and diversity of dinosaurs.In the 1960s, the identification of the smallish meat-eating dinosaur Deinonychus shook up dinosaur science, helping inaugurate a research period called the ""Dinosaur Renaissance."" It showed that dinosaurs could be small and agile. Some were remarkably similar anatomically to early birds like Archaeopteryx, confirming how birds evolved from small, feathered dinosaurs. It also prompted a debate over whether dinosaurs were warm-blooded like birds, contradicting the long-standing conception of them as slow, lumbering and cold-blooded.feathered dinosaurs[1/5]An Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton is seen at the Smithsonian?s Natural History Museum dinosaur and fossil hall in Washington, U.S., June 4, 2019.

Some even proposed that the shrew-sized mammals of the time ate up the dinosaur eggs.extinction of the dinosaursIn 1980, researchers identified a layer of sediment dating precisely to the end of the dinosaur age containing high concentrations of iridium, an element common in meteorites, indicating a huge space rock had struck Earth. The Chicxulub crater at Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula - 112 miles (180 km) wide - subsequently was identified as the impact site of the asteroid that wiped out three-quarters of Earth's species, including the dinosaurs.the impact sitethe asteroidwiped outHad that asteroid missed Earth, would dinosaurs still rule, instead of the mammals - eventually including humans - that inherited a shattered world?""Almost certainly yes,"" Holtz said. ""Mammals arose not long after the first dinosaurs, but spent many tens of millions of years in their shadows. Mesozoic mammals were highly successful and diverse, but only at smaller body sizes.""""The dinosaurs would have had to deal with the eventual drying and cooling of the world, and with it the reduction of the forests and their replacement with grasslands,"" Holtz added. ""But these changes seem to have been gradual enough that the dinosaurs would have had a chance to evolve adaptations to the new conditions, just as large mammals did.""Scientists have evaluated the metabolism of dinosaurs using a formula based on body mass, as revealed by the bulk of their thigh bones, and growth rates, as shown by growth rings in fossil bones akin to those in trees. The research suggested dinosaurs were intermediate to today's warm-blooded and cold-blooded animals.Scientists have also refined their assessment of the size of various dinosaurs, including the sauropod group that numbered among them the largest land animals in Earth's history.

https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-factory-boom-disproportionately-favors-poorer-counties-study-shows-2024-02-13/,Built-in bias: Study finds US factory boom disproportionately favors poorer counties,By Timothy Aeppel,"February 13, 2024",A,"Feb 13 (Reuters) - A surge of factory building fueled by Biden administration investments in ""strategic sectors"" such as clean energy and semiconductors has so far flowed disproportionately to U.S. counties with relatively distressed economies and notably has not tracked ""Democratic geography.""Since 2021, a group of counties with relatively low employment rates for prime-age workers and low median household incomes - while accounting for only about 8% of national GDP - snared 16% of the $525 billion in announced investments, according to a data analysis by the Brookings Institution and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.The study underscores how the embrace of a more muscular industrial policy under Democratic President Joe Biden could spread investments into regions left behind by decades of offshoring.Joe BidenIndustrial policy was long anathema to many U.S. economists and politicians who viewed it as unfairly favoring some industries and regions over others. But the strategy has gained support from a wide swath of the political spectrum, including Republicans, many of them from regions that are now benefiting from the latest push to bolster key businesses.Mark Muro, a senior fellow in Brookings' Metro program and one of the authors of the study, said the data shows these federal programs are tiled ""toward smaller-town areas that are less prosperous.""Advertisement · Scroll to continueTo the extent that the new push toward industrial policy is a factor in some of these investments, the data suggests ""that policy has not simply followed Democratic geography,"" he said.Indeed, a disproportionate share of the locales are Republican strongholds that regardless of Biden's largesse lean heavily toward former President Donald Trump in the run-up to the Nov. 5 election, which is shaping up to be a rematch between the two men. In polling, Biden persistently gets low marks for his handling of the economy despite historically low unemployment, persistently strong job growth, and above-average wage increases, especially for the lowest-earning workers.Donald TrumpAdvertisement · Scroll to continue'SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURE'The report credits three major pieces of federal legislation enacted under Biden - the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act - with driving the investment boom. These laws, passed in 2021 and 2022, fund a range of subsidies and tax incentives that encourage companies to place projects in disadvantaged regions. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act has tax credits that include bonuses of at least 10% when an investment is placed in a low-income community.Advertisement · Scroll to continueThe researchers defined counties as distressed when they have a median household income below $75,000 and a prime-age employment gap of more than 5%. The employment gap is a widely used gauge of economic health that measures the difference between the national five-year average in the jobless rate for prime-age workers and the average for those workers in a particular county or region.As of 2022, there were 1,071 U.S. counties that fell into this category - together representing 13% of the U.S. population. The study found those counties have received nearly $82 billion of announced investments, double their share of gross domestic product and 1.2 times their share of the population.Advertisement · Scroll to continueThese investments are concentrated in the southern U.S. but extend across other regions - touching 27 states, the report found.The researchers also compared the recent wave of investments to overall private investments from 2010 to 2020 and found that the latest wave is much more likely to target distressed counties, ""suggesting a significant departure from geographic patterns of prior investment,"" the report said.Even among these poorer counties, some appear to hold an advantage over others when it comes to attracting new factories. The analysis found that the 70 distressed counties among the 1,071 that have landed investments are those that already had relatively high shares of employment in so-called advanced industries - such as auto manufacturing and clean energy.""In general, places that are nearer to sources of labor, nearer to suppliers, seem to benefit,"" Muro said.Reporting by Timothy Aeppel; Editing by Paul SimaoOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabPurchase Licensing RightsTimothy AeppelThomson ReutersTim Aeppel covers the intersection of economics and companies, with an emphasis on manufacturing.

Through interviews and government records, the news organization documented at least 600 previously unreported injuries of SpaceX workers since 2014.disregarded worker-safety regulations and standard practicesSpaceX has not responded to Reuters’ questions about any of the incidents, including the death of one worker and the injury of another who remains in a coma after his skull was fractured during a 2022 rocket engine malfunction. The company also did not respond to a request for comment about the new safety fine.Inspectors from Washington state’s Department of Labor and Industries discovered new safety violations at the company’s Redmond, Washington, site last December, in a visit prompted by worker complaints, according to state inspection records obtained by Reuters under an open records request. An agency spokesperson said that SpaceX can still appeal the decision.Advertisement · Scroll to continueThe inspectors concluded the site lacked a “thorough safety program,” adequate communication of work rules, and a system to “correct violations,” the records said. The “near amputation,” as inspectors called it, occurred after a roll of material fell and crushed a worker’s foot.Managers at SpaceX told the state inspectors that it was a one-time incident and the problem was fixed.Inspectors, however, found that employees were not required to wear steel-toe shoes, even though the rolls of materials they had to load into a machine had gotten heavier - increasing from about 80 pounds to 300 pounds (36 kg to 136 kg) each. The violation was described as serious given the risk of injury, an agency spokesperson said.Advertisement · Scroll to continueOne worker at the site told inspectors that “safety can get overlooked” because the company’s “goal is to make as much as we can in a short amount of time,” according to the records. The injured worker said the machine where the rolls were loaded “had been deliberately set up incorrectly for the purpose of increasing the production rate during the material loading phase.”The worker, who was not identified in the report, told inspectors that the matter had not been addressed and that safety officials at the company do not “have the reading comprehension nor the overall competency to implement a safety plan at the Redmond site.”Advertisement · Scroll to continueIn a separate incident reported less than 24 hours later, an unidentified Redmond employee was hospitalized for a broken ankle after they jumped off a dock during a fire alarm, which inspectors said the company could not have foreseen. SpaceX was not fined as a result.The Reuters report last year found that worker safety agencies fined the billionaire’s rocket company a total of $50,836 for various violations in the last decade.Advertisement · Scroll to continueSpaceX’s history of injuries and regulatory run-ins underscores the limits of worker-safety regulation. Fines are capped by law and pose little deterrent for major companies, according to experts in U.S. worker safety. Federal and state regulators also suffer from chronic understaffing of inspectors, they said.The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which has paid SpaceX more than $11.8 billion as a private space contractor, did not respond to questions about the matter. The space agency has repeatedly declined to comment on the company’s safety record, saying only that the agency has the option of enforcing contract provisions that require SpaceX to “have a robust and effective safety program and culture.”Last month, the wife of the worker who is in a coma after his skull was fractured filed a negligence lawsuit against the company.

Two years ago, this category did not exist ... at all,"" he told Reuters.Fedorov, 33, has been at the heart of Ukraine's effort to nurture private military startups to innovate and build up the drone industry as the war goes into its third year and Ukraine seeks new ways to fight back against well dug-in Russian forces.Advertisement · Scroll to continueThe recent series of strikes on oil facilities, he said, reflected the government's progress in rapidly deregulating the drone market and increasing funding for it, with the state acting as a venture investor.seriesSome $2.5 million in grants were allocated to military tech startups via the BRAVE1 initiative set up by the government last year, an amount set to be increased roughly tenfold in 2024, he said.Advertisement · Scroll to continue""We will fight to increase the financing even more,"" he added.In contrast with Russia where drone production is dominated by the state, the vast majority of manufacturers in Ukraine are private. Fedorov said only one of the 10 companies whose drones could fly as far as the regions around Moscow or St Petersburg was a state company.Since the first year of the full-scale war, Russia has used thousands of Iranian ""Shahed"" drones that fly towards their target and detonate on impact for long-range strikes.Advertisement · Scroll to continueUkraine's production levels and deliveries increased more than 120 times in 2023, according to Fedorov, part of a broader wartime push to develop and produce drones to narrow the gap with Russia's strike capabilities.Fedorov said he agreed with an assessment by Ukraine's military spy chief Kyrylo Budanov that Kyiv had achieved a ""certain kind of parity"" with Moscow in the production of long-range drones.Advertisement · Scroll to continue""We need to act in an anti-bureaucratic way. This is the essence of a breakthrough in the war of technology. We are going to continue to put our bets on this, to work in this direction. Because technology can really save us,"" he said, noting the shortage of artillery rounds Ukrainian troops were facing.ENDING THE MONOPOLIESOverall, more than 300,000 drones of different types were contracted last year and more than 100,000 were sent to the front, he said, adding that the figures did not cover volunteer supplies which he said made a ""significant contribution"".""We removed taxes on UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) components, simplified the contracting procedure, and the procedure for decommissioning,"" he said.""In other words, we took all the blockages that private sector companies were facing and addressed them in six months by passing all the necessary laws and resolutions.""President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has set a target for Ukraine this year to produce one million First Person View (FPV) drones, which are cheap to make and weaponised in huge quantities by both sides on the front.Ukraine's drone industry relies heavily on components from foreign countries, including China, widely seen as an ally of Russia. Fedorov said there was an effort to localise production of components.""That's why I think that if we continue this trend, by the end of this year we will have a lot of companies that have already made more than 50% of their components locally.""The surge in recent production put such a strain on logistics that changes had to be rapidly made to prevent long delays in deliveries, he said.""In December alone, drone deliveries were 50 times higher than in the entire 2022. Just imagine, the system was not prepared for that, and I think the logistics did not realize that such volumes were possible.""The private sector was also held back by a state monopoly on making drone ammunition. Ukraine passed a resolution ending that state monopoly three months ago and later halted a separate one on making artillery rounds and rockets, he said.""Over the past three months, more than 20 companies have already undergone testing and can now hand over ammunition to the state,"" he said.Ukraine has trained 20,000 drone operators since it launched a programme to provide grants for military training in private schools at the beginning of 2023, he said. There were 20 such schools, he added.""We pay for every military person who comes to these schools. Now we have a plan to turn this into a larger state program and separately to modernize, update several training centres and make them work at a high level.""Reporting by Tom Balmforth; editing by Mike Collett-White and Giles ElgoodOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabPurchase Licensing Rights"

Pemex has in the past denied any leaks at the platform and did not comment on the new U.N. data.two major methane leaksReducing methane leaks from oil and gas infrastructure is one of the cheapest and most effective ways to slow climate change in the short term. Mexico is among many countries that have pledged to reduce methane emissions.Methane is a much more potent driver of climate change in the short term than carbon dioxide because it traps more heat in the atmosphere, tonne for tonne. Recently, new technology has made it easier to find and fix large leaks of the colorless and odorless gas.MethaneAdvertisement · Scroll to continueReuters first reported in 2022 that researchers had spotted methane leaking from the platform, most likely because of an issue with a flare at the site. A Mexican senator then filed a criminal complaint that year against the Pemex CEO, the energy minister at that time, and the head of the environmental agency for the oil and gas sector, citing Reuters stories. In Mexico, the status of a criminal complaint is not made public until it is decided.criminal complaintciting Reuters storiesAdvertisement · Scroll to continueIn 2023, the United Nations Environment Programme’s (UNEP) International Methane Emissions Observatory launched a program to notify governments and energy companies of large methane emissions. The goal is that, once leaks are found and flagged, they will be fixed.Data from the program was made public on December 1, 2023. Reuters used spatial data analysis tools to look for recurring leaks that had triggered notifications in that data, which describes more than 1,600 methane detections around the world.Advertisement · Scroll to continueReuters identified a cluster of plumes observed on 25 different days in 2023 off the coast of Mexico, and then discovered that they were at the location of the platform flagged in the 2022 paper. UNEP confirmed the plumes identified by Reuters were from Pemex's Zaap-C platform.A UNEP spokesman said IMEO, the methane observatory, told the Mexican government about the first nine plumes shortly after identifying them in July. It did not send repeat notifications during the program's first year, so later detections did not trigger notifications. They declined to describe Mexico's response or their communication with the government in more detail.Advertisement · Scroll to continueNeither Pemex nor the president's office, the energy ministry nor the environmental regulator for the oil and gas sector responded to requests for comment.Reuters could not determine whether Pemex has taken steps to address the leaks. Because UNEP releases data 45 to 75 days after detection, its data does not show whether the platform is leaking now.A FIXABLE PROBLEMResearchers tend to assume the methane plumes they find will be fixed, said Evan Sherwin, a research scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, who studies methane emissions from oil and gas operations. He was not involved in the Zaap-C paper.Sherwin said the leak at Zaap-C appeared to be an unlit flare which should be technically feasible to resolve. ""This is a fixable problem,"" he said.The UNEP monitoring system, set up with support from the United States, the European Union and others, does not impose any consequences if the notifications are ignored.Mexico is among 156 countries that have promised to reduce methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030 under the voluntary Global Methane Pledge.The UNEP data showed that methane leaks at the Zaap-C platform were detected in April, May, July, August, September, October and November. Reuters was unable to determine the total volume of methane released.Scientists analyzing satellite data can estimate the rate that methane is leaking from sites like Zaap-C at single points in time. But because satellites circle the earth and detections depend on things like the position of the sun and clouds, it is rarely possible to know how long platforms are leaking for, and therefore the total volume of methane released.Manfredi Caltagirone, head of the UN methane observatory, noted the Zaap-C plumes were ""very, very significant"" emissions, enough to be visible from space.U.N. data estimated between 13 and just over 100 tonnes of methane per hour were being released into the atmosphere at the times of detection. The International Energy Agency, an intergovernmental organization that publishes data and policy advice on the energy sector, estimated that the entire energy industry released roughly 135 million tonnes of methane in 2022, which works out to about 15,400 tonnes per hour.Other large leaks have also been linked to unlit flares. Like other companies, Pemex burns off, or flares, gas because it lacks the infrastructure to capture, process and transport it away for other uses.When the gas is burned in the flare, methane, the main component, converts to carbon dioxide and other components that are less harmful to the environment in the short term.After Reuters reported on the 2022 detection, Pemex said the scientists had mistaken methane for nitrogen, which is the most plentiful element in the Earth's atmosphere and harmless.Pemex did not explain how it came to that conclusion. It also did not release the findings of its internal study or respond to Reuters requests for a copy.The scientists involved in the 2022 study said, in response to Pemex’s statement, that the sensor used to detect methane cannot detect nitrogen.cannot detect nitrogenReporting by Allison Martell in Toronto and Stefanie Eschenbacher in Mexico City; editing by Claudia ParsonsOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabPurchase Licensing RightsStefanie EschenbacherThomson ReutersStefanie covers energy, the environment and climate change across Mexico and Central America - with a particular focus on the troubled Mexican state oil company Pemex and its emissions.

It’s easier to single out those that don’t, including big technology outfits Alphabet (GOOGL.O) , opens new tab and Amazon.com (AMZN.O) , opens new tab , than those that do. Dividends are popular and becoming more so: Morningstar analysts count $1 trillion of funds targeting dividend payers, a number that has increased 10% annually since 2018.

They’re clear-cut and equitable, since all holders of regular shares get them in proportion to their economic stake. But just because something is common or coveted doesn’t make it smart. In practice, dividends provide zero value for shareholders. For some, they’re worse than being given no cash at all, and for tax reasons are often less appealing than other ways companies can distribute funds, if they decide they have no better use for the money.Advertisement · Scroll to continueReuters Graphics Reuters GraphicsNOTHING FROM SOMETHINGIn a very straightforward sense, dividends don’t give investors anything they don’t already own. If a company pays $1 in cash to its investors, the value of what’s left, which is represented by its share price, should fall by exactly $1. This makes dividend payments a very different proposition from, say, interest paid on a bond. An investor that wants to wring cash from backing Meta could simply sell a fraction of a share every three months. Once, that would have been complicated. Now it’s not: brokerages including Robinhood Financial and Charles Schwab (SCHW.N) , opens new tab let U.S. customers offload slivers of shares without fees or commissions.(SCHW.N) , opens new tabAdvertisement · Scroll to continueIn the real world, receiving dividends can prove worse than no payout at all. The typical U.S. investor gives up to 20% of what they receive to Uncle Sam in taxes if they’ve held the stock for more than a couple of months. If they instead sell shares to generate cash, a similar tax rate is applied, but only to the capital gain achieved since the original purchase. Assuming they eventually sell their entire holding, the tax paid should even out. But investors who manufacture dividends themselves would have chosen exactly when to pay, and deferred some of the cost. For the many foreign investors who pay higher tax rates on income than capital gains, dividends are positively punitive.Advertisement · Scroll to continueThe question then is why investors like dividends at all. It’s hard to find a rational answer. Samuel Hartzmark and David Solomon at Boston College Carroll School of Management concluded that one reason is a logical disconnect , opens new tab : investors simply don’t grasp that dividends reduce the value of the companies paying them. Instead, they act as if dividends and share-price performance exist in parallel universes. Indeed, the herd-like quest for dividends, say when interest rates are low, could lead to valuation distortions that shave 4% off investors’ returns over a one-year period, the study estimated.logical disconnect , opens new tabEven investors who do understand the mechanics may just like the idea of having extra money in their pockets.

Warren Buffett has resolutely distanced his Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) , opens new tab from the cult of the dividend. He prefers stock buybacks , opens new tab , which allow him to exploit perceived low prices in his conglomerate’s shares.

For one, they are financially a little more appealing than buybacks. President Joe Biden approved a tax , opens new tab on stock repurchases in 2022, based on the dubious notion that companies would therefore invest more in their operations and employees. He later said he hopes to quadruple the levy’s rate to 4%. Dividends may also be slightly cheaper to administer than buybacks since they eliminate any investment banking fees for scooping up shares in the market.approved a tax , opens new tabReuters GraphicsFurthermore, if investors stick with their dividend fetish, it’s perfectly rational for chief executives like Zuckerberg to take advantage. Paying a dividend could allow Meta shares to be included in mutual and exchange-traded funds that only hold shares in companies making regular payouts. Such funds buy 0.5% of a company’s outstanding shares the year after it initiates a dividend, Goldman Sachs analysts have found. The Wall Street bank, in a report published on Monday, cites data suggesting that debuting a regular payout can push a stock’s price up 2%, while missing a dividend payment can wipe out 9% of a company’s market value.Ultimately, the main appeal of dividends is that they’re a signal: the company paying them is saying it thinks its earnings will support a regular stream of cash, and that it will have one eye on its shareholders even as it invests in future projects. That might explain Meta’s decision to offer $5.3 billion a year in payouts at the same time it is earmarking up to $9 billion more investment this year than last, mainly on servers and data centers.There’s a big danger in confusing correlation with causality, however. Stable, responsible and steadily growing companies pay dividends, which means that such stocks in aggregate might indeed outperform other securities. It doesn’t mean that the dividend itself makes a company a better investment. Considering Meta is renowned for shaking up the status quo, its payout is strangely off-brand. And yet to become a social media powerhouse requires a full understanding of how emotion regularly trumps logic, making the tech giant a perfectly sensible entrant to the dividend multiverse of madness.(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

They even convinced a special committee of Oracle’s board to allow them to move forward with a case seeking billions of dollars from other Oracle directors – an exceedingly rare concession in shareholder derivative litigation. But ultimately, Robbins Geller and Friedlander & Gorris couldn’t prove their claims at trial.convincedAdvertisement · Scroll to continueThey nevertheless sought fees because Oracle appointed two independent directors to its board in 2018, after shareholders survived an initial motion to dismiss the derivative suit alleging conflicts in the NetSuite acquisition. The two new members rejiggered the composition of the board, creating an even split between independent board members and directors with ties to Ellison.Robbins Geller and Friedlander & Gorris argued that their litigation prodded Oracle to beef up the ranks of independent board members -- a meaningful corporate benefit that, the plaintiffs firms said, merited a $5 million fee award.Advertisement · Scroll to continueThat argument was not as audacious as it might seem on its face. Plaintiffs lawyers pointed out, in both their initial fee motion and their reply brief , opens new tab defending the request, that a long line of Delaware precedent rewards shareholder lawyers for securing the appointment of new board members.reply brief , opens new tabEven when shareholders did not ask in their complaints for new directors, the firms argued, Chancery Court judges have often awarded them fees for obtaining settlements that required companies to improve corporate governance, including the appointment of new board members.Advertisement · Scroll to continueBut Oracle’s lawyers at Richards, Layton & Finger argued , opens new tab that this case is different. For one thing, they said, Oracle did not appoint new directors because of the litigation. The company had been on a mission to add independent directors before the NetSuite lawsuit was even filed, Oracle said, so it would make no sense to credit plaintiffs lawyers for making the board more independent.argued , opens new tabMoreover, Oracle said, when Delaware judges have rewarded plaintiffs lawyers for obtaining corporate governance reforms, it’s been the context of settlements that resolved shareholders’ cases. But in the NetSuite deal litigation, shareholders continued litigating for years after Oracle appointed new directors in 2018.Advertisement · Scroll to continueOracle’s directors, the company said, had to spend tens of millions of dollars to defend the case, far outweighing whatever corporate benefit the company derived from the appointment of new directors -- and contradicting any argument that plaintiffs lawyers are entitled to a mootness fee based on the appointment. The appointment of new directors, according to Oracle, didn’t moot the case, which went on for years after the composition of the board changed. Robbins Geller and Friedlander & Gorris, Oracle said, can’t receive a mootness fee for a purported benefit that didn't end the case.Glasscock agreed. Even if Oracle did appoint new directors because of the shareholder derivative suit, the judge said, that wasn’t the aim of the litigation, which sought to hold board members liable for allegedly bowing to Ellison and paying too much to acquire NetSuite.Shareholders never asked Oracle to bolster the board’s independence, the judge said. So, at best, the appointment of additional independent board members was “incidental” to their case, Glasscock said.The judge echoed Oracle’s distinction between this litigation and cases in which shareholder firms received fees for obtaining corporate governance benefits in settlements. In those cases, Glasscock said, plaintiffs compromised, trading unresolved claims for governance reforms.Robbins Geller and Friedlander & Gorris chose not to make that trade, Glasscock said.They opted instead for protracted litigation on their claim for money damages – and lost. To reward them after the fact for a “collateral” corporate governance benefit, the judge said, “would create an unwholesome incentive.”“I feel sympathy for plaintiffs’ counsel here, who proceeded derivatively, in good faith and with great skill and vigor, at great cost and effort to themselves,” Glasscock said. “Nonetheless, this is counsels’ business model: sue derivatively, on a contingency basis, accept the freight in a losing case, while seeking a multiple of a lodestar in a successful one.”Joel Friedlander of the eponymous firm and Randall Baron of Robbins Geller declined to comment. An Oracle spokesperson and Oracle counsel from Richards Layton did not respond to my query.One intriguing effect of Glasscock’s ruling may be that plaintiffs lawyers will start adding boilerplate demands for corporate governance reforms to derivative complaints. That way, if a company appoints new directors or otherwise tightens up its corporate governance in the course of the litigation, shareholders can argue that the reforms were tied to their demands.Read more:Judge in Oracle case clarifies 'odor of denigrating' women comment, praises lawyersJudge in Oracle case clarifies 'odor of denigrating' women comment, praises lawyersLawyers suing Oracle draw judge's reproach for arguments with 'odor of denigrating' womenLawyers suing Oracle draw judge's reproach for arguments with 'odor of denigrating' womenOracle directors -- Shareholders can go ahead with billion-dollar derivative suitOracle directors -- Shareholders can go ahead with billion-dollar derivative suitJumpstart your morning with top legal news delivered straight to your inbox from The Daily Docket , opens new tab .The Daily Docket , opens new tabReporting By Alison FrankelOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabOpinions expressed are those of the author.

The FAA must certify new airplanes as safe before they can be delivered to airlines.Advertisement · Scroll to continueSenate Commerce committee chair Maria Cantwell, whose committee oversees aviation, said on Thursday she plans to call Whitaker for a hearing to discuss his idea in the coming months.""The issue is how do you have the right technical people that really understand the technology and how do you get them in the FAA system, in the oversight system to be on the job now,"" said Cantwell.

In 2019, it told Congress it would need an additional 10,000 employees that would cost $1.8 billion annually if it were to assume all responsibilities for aircraft certification.Arjun Garg, a former FAA chief counsel and acting deputy administrator, said the agency likely wouldn't be speaking about the idea in public without having already given it thorough consideration.Advertisement · Scroll to continueHe added that experts who specialize in aircraft engineering and manufacturing processes could perform that type of independent review, adding that entities such as the Flight Safety Foundation or Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, which are well known and well regarded in aviation, could bring rigor and credibility to the task.Problems with aircraft certification are not new. A December 2021 Senate report found ""FAA's certification process suffers from undue pressure on line engineers and production staff.""In 2020, FAA employees reported fearing pressure from Boeing, with one employee saying: ""It feels like we are showing up to a knife fight with Nerf weapons.""fearing pressure from BoeingFormer House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee chair Peter DeFazio, who led a massive investigation into two earlier MAX crashes that killed 346 people, is skeptical of the third party idea.""I know of no such entity ready to step in,"" he said.

Ukrainian armed forces commander General Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, who was replaced on Thursday, became a national hero for repelling Moscow's invading forces two years ago but suffered battlefield setbacks as the war ground on.The move ends intense speculation over his fate after reported frictions between him and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whose authority will be tested as he seeks to rally troops under a new army chief and change the dynamic of the war.Ukrainian forces are struggling after a counteroffensive launched last June made little headway in the south and east, while Russian forces are inflicting small but costly defeats at several points along the 1,000-km (620-mile)front.Western military and financial support is no longer guaranteed, leaving Kyiv more exposed to attacks by Russian drones and missiles that are sapping Ukrainian resources.Advertisement · Scroll to continueGiven Zaluznhyi's popularity and proven ability as an inspiring commander, the fact that Zelenskiy is replacing him may reflect the desire for a new approach on the battlefield.In an opinion piece published by CNN on Feb. 1, Zaluhznyi repeated his view that Ukraine could compete with Russia's much bigger army only through technological innovation including drones and other advanced weaponry.opinion pieceHe also criticised state institutions for failing to push through unpopular legislation that would reform the way Ukrainians are mobilised to fight, amid a shortage of soldiers and growing exhaustion among those already serving.Advertisement · Scroll to continueA HERO TO MANYDefying the odds, Ukraine's soldiers used stealth and speed to thwart Russia's advance on Kyiv in February, 2022, helping to ensure that, even now, Russian President Vladimir Putin remains a long way from conquering Ukraine.As the war progressed, Zaluzhnyi's stock rose, and he won praise at home and abroad when his forces launched counteroffensives in the northeast and south that recaptured swathes of land and raised hopes of an unlikely victory.Advertisement · Scroll to continueA portrait of him smiling and flashing the peace sign was spray-painted on walls after the liberation of the southern city of Kherson, under the slogan ""God and Zaluzhnyi are with us"".Since then, Ukraine's battlefield momentum has stalled, yet polling indicated that Zaluzhnyi was still trusted by 92% of Ukrainians late last year, significantly above Zelenskiy's 77%.Reported frictions between the two men burst into the open in November after Zaluzhnyi was quoted by the Economist as saying the war as at a ""stalemate"", a gloomy assessment that jarred with Zelenskiy's more optimistic vision.Advertisement · Scroll to continueThe 50-year-old four-star general, who rarely speaks in public but is occasionally shown on news bulletins poring over maps and addressing commanders in fatigues, said then too that better technology was the key to breaking the impasse.The president's office rebuked him, and one of Zaluzhnyi's senior officers said he had been sacked by Zelenskiy over the general's head.Were he to go into politics - though he has never voiced political ambitions - the ""Iron General"" could prove a formidable force.THE BURLY 'VOLUNTEER'Zaluzhnyi began his military training in the 1990s, after Ukraine gained independence from the Soviet Union, graduating with honours and rising up the ranks.He got a taste of real conflict in 2014 when he served in an area of eastern Ukraine where Russian-backed militants had seized territory.Tall and burly with cropped hair, Zaluzhnyi, whose military call sign is ""Volunteer"", has a reputation for having a good rapport with his subordinates and allowing local commanders to make their own decisions on the battlefield.His warning in November that the war was sliding into an attritional phase that suited Russia was out of kilter with Kyiv's official rhetoric, but for many of his soldiers it was recognition of the painful reality on the battlefield.Russia had been building up fortifications since late 2022 after suffering humiliating defeats in the Kharkiv and Kherson regions, with more recent Ukrainian advances thwarted.fortificationsTens of thousands of soldiers have been killed and wounded on both sides, although there are no reliable official figures.Ukraine desperately needs to replenish its overstretched and exhausted ranks but the government has been unable to amend call-up laws to help recruit up to half a million more soldiers.Kyiv has also struggled to maintain Western support that has been vital to its war effort.The United States has failed to deliver a hefty aid package it had promised, although, in a boost for Ukraine, the European Union agreed to extend $54 billion in new support, overcoming weeks of resistance from Hungary.agreedEven so, as the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War Two enters its third year, Zaluzhnyi's boots will be hard to fill.Writing by Mike Collett-White; Editing by Jon BoyleOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabPurchase Licensing Rights"

In stark contrast, installations across Europe fell by 18% to 14 GW.The sharp rise in Germany follows a range of laws passed by Germany's Social Democrat-Green-Liberal coalition since 2021 to accelerate renewable energy capacity and end the country’s reliance on Russian fossil fuels. Germany currently operates 61 GW of onshore wind capacity and aims to reach 115 GW by 2030.

https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/how-patent-office-director-review-has-reshaped-rehearing-landscape-2024-02-07/,How patent office director review has reshaped the rehearing landscape,By James M. Glass and Christopher Smith,"February 7, 2024",J,"Law FirmsQuinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLPQuinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLPFollowFebruary 7, 2024 - Recent changes to the process of requesting review of Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) decisions has given practitioners new options and led to significant changes in both the number of reviews requested and the decisions resulting from those requests. The 2021 Supreme Court decision in United States v. Arthrex regarding the scope of decision-making authority of administrative patent judges prompted the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to develop new processes for ensuring the availability of director review of administrative patent judges.Below we examine the rehearing landscape both pre- and post-Arthrex, in order to help guide practitioners seeking review to select which process is most suitable to their practice.BackgroundPractitioners before the USPTO have long had the option to seek review of PTAB decisions either by requesting a rehearing or by requesting review by the PTAB's Precedential Opinion Panel (POP). Until recently, this was the only recourse for a dissatisfied patent prosecutor, and the only decisional review available in post-grant proceedings short of an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Now, however, parties seeking review have a choice between requesting a rehearing and requesting director review.Advertisement · Scroll to continueSince the Supreme Court's June 21, 2021, decision in Arthrex, practitioners have had the option to request Director Review of PTAB decisions. See United States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. ___ (2021), available here , opens new tab . In April of 2022, the USPTO began formalizing requests for director review by implementing the Interim Director Review process. The Director Review process is still nascent, and it has undergone several revisions in the last two years (see here , opens new tab for the most recent update).here , opens new tabhere , opens new tabAdvertisement · Scroll to continueOriginally, requests for director review were limited to final decisions of the Board in Post-Grant Review, Inter Partes Review, and Covered Business Method Review proceedings. For example, the Director dismissed two requests for review of ex parte appeal decisions in early 2022 stating that ""[a]t this time, the Office does not accept requests for Director review of … ex parte appeal decisions; parties may only request Director review of final written decisions in inter partes reviews and post-grant reviews."" See Ex Parte 2021-000960 and Ex Parte 2017-006002.Advertisement · Scroll to continueOn July 24, 2023, the USPTO announced updated guidance that included sweeping changes updating the interim director review process to encompass director review of PTAB decisions on institution of AIA (America Invents Act) proceedings, providing the Director the option to delegate review to a Delegated Rehearing Panel (DRP), and retiring the POP in favor of the newly created Appeals Review Panel (ARP) to review PTAB ex parte, reexamination, and reissue appeal decisions, which the Director may convene sua sponte or upon request. See here , opens new tab .here , opens new tabAdvertisement · Scroll to continueIn short, following these changes practitioners can now request director review of appeal decisions, decisions on institution of AIA proceedings, and final decisions from AIA proceedings. However, these options are mutually exclusive, as director review and requests for rehearing cannot be sought simultaneously, and pursuing one forecloses the opportunity to pursue the other. It is therefore incumbent upon practitioners to carefully consider the merits of each option before submitting a request.Comparison of director review and POP processesEight hundred fifty-nine days passed between the June 21, 2021, decision in Arthrex and Oct. 28, 2023. We collected the number of requests and outcome of each request for rehearing that came before the PTAB during this time frame, as well as the number and outcome of each request for rehearing that came before the PTAB in the preceding 859-day period between Feb. 13, 2019, and June 20, 2021.We have also collected and calculated the grant rate of requests for director review post-Arthrex, and the grant rate and number of requests for POP review. Finally, we've compared the average time to decision over the last 90 days for director requests and requests for rehearing. Examining the numbers reveals that the change in processes has coincided with a staggering decline in rehearing requests and decisions and provides insight into likely outcomes.Post-Arthrex, there have been 279 requests for director review, of which 253 have reached disposition. Of those that reached disposition, only 7 have been granted, compared to 232 requests that were denied and 14 requests that were dismissed as improper. This represents a grant rate of 2.7%. The most common reason cited for dismissal was untimely filing of the request, which must be submitted within 30 days of a final decision, or within 14 days of a decision to institute trial. See here , opens new tab , 37 CFR § 42.71(d).here , opens new tabThe modal average time (the most frequent time) between request and decision was 60 days, while the median time to decision was 54 days. Of the requests for director review, 258 were requests to review decisions in AIA proceedings, with 219 requests to review IPR (inter partes review) decisions, 6 requests to review PGR (post-grant review) decisions, and 11 requests to review CBM (covered business method) review decisions. The only requests for director review granted so far have been requests to review decisions in IPR proceedings. This is summarized in the table below:Table-01 Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tabPurchase Licensing Rights , opens new tabBy comparison, since its institution in 2018 to its retirement in July 2023, the POP has reviewed 342 of 375 requests, of which 5 were granted, 321 were denied, and 16 were dismissed. See here , opens new tab ; the request tracker spreadsheet shows 363 POP requests as ""completed,"" but this represents an additional 4 requests that were terminated and 17 that were withdrawn voluntarily.here , opens new tabIncluding only the reviewed requests, this represents a grant rate of 1.4%. The modal average time to decision was 78 days, and the median time to decision was 58 days. Note that this average excludes four entries from the PTAB's POP decisions spreadsheet each showing a disposition date earlier than the recorded request date, which the authors assume to be erroneously recorded.Of the requests for review by the POP, 331 were requests to review decisions in AIA proceedings, with 320 requests to review IPR decisions, and 11 requests to review PGR decisions. The only POP requests granted so far have been requests to review decisions in IPR proceedings. See here , opens new tab . This is summarized in the table below:here , opens new tabTable-02 Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tabPurchase Licensing Rights , opens new tabSo far, the director review process has led to outcomes similar to what was seen with the POP process — very few grants of review, and of those only IPR decisions, with an average time to decision of about two months. The opening up of director review to ex parte and other appeal decisions may lead to changes in the future; so far, no requests for director review of an appeal have been made since that option became available.Comparison of requests for rehearing before and after <i>Arthrex</i>In the 859-day period post-Arthrex from June 21, 2021, to Oct. 28, 2023, the board issued 403 decisions on requests for rehearing. In the 859-day period immediately preceding Arthrex, between Feb. 12, 2019, and June 20, 2021, the board issued 818 decisions on requests for rehearing. This represents a staggering decline in rehearing decisions, post-Arthrex, of 49.3%.Even if the requests for director review are added to the requests for rehearing, this still represents a drop of over 16.6% in requests for decisional review. The disparities pre- and post-Arthrex are even more stark when broken down by proceeding type and technology center (i.e., which technology group within the USPTO reviews a patent based on its technology classification). A summary of these statistics is shown below.Post-Arthrex decision statistic Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tabPurchase Licensing Rights , opens new tabPre-Arthrex decision statistic Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tabPurchase Licensing Rights , opens new tabAs the summary shows, the differences before and after Arthrex in the number of rehearing decisions issued, and the percentage of those that were granted, varies dramatically between proceeding type and the tech center of the patent at issue.The grant rate for rehearing of AIA decisions has increased dramatically, with the percentage for IPRs increasing by more than a factor of 13, while the percentage of PGR rehearings granted has increased by a factor of 7. Meanwhile, the likelihood of a request for rehearing on an ex parte or other appeal being granted has stayed nearly the same as it was pre-Arthrex.Likewise, while the grant rates for all tech sectors have increased, certain tech centers have seen the likelihood of a favorable rehearing decision increase dramatically, with the grant rates of tech centers 1600 and 2800 increasing by a factor of 4, while others have seen more modest increase, such as sector 3600, whose grant rate has increased by less than 1%.The reason for these disparities is unclear, but the numbers of requests offer a clue. The number of requests for rehearing of decisions in AIA proceedings that were granted is nearly the same pre- and post-Arthrex, at 25 and 26, respectively. But the total number of requests for rehearing in AIA decisions has plummeted by nearly 90%.In contrast, the total number of requests for rehearing stemming from appeals has dropped by only 17.8%, and although the grant rate has risen slightly, the total number of granted requests for hearing from appeals has actually decreased.With the drop in requests for rehearing, and the concomitant increase in grant rates, request for rehearing presents an attractive option for practitioners seeking review of a PTAB decision. While the director review process presents an additional option for practitioners, it is still evolving, and it remains to be seen how the process will ultimately be utilized.Opinions expressed are those of the author.

https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/chinas-refined-nickel-trade-signals-new-production-trends-2024-02-06/,China's refined nickel trade signals new production trends,By Andy Home,"February 7, 2024",C,"LONDON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - China's net imports of refined nickel fell to a near-decade low in 2023, capturing the tectonic shifts playing out in the global production chain.China's call on Class I high-purity nickel has been waning for many months as the country ramps up imports of other forms of the metal from Indonesia.Much of that Indonesian material has traditionally been nickel pig iron (NPI) heading for China's stainless steel sector.More recently, trade flows have included rising amounts of matte and mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP) destined for conversion into electric vehicle batteries.The latest evolution is the ability of Chinese operators to convert intermediates into refined metal, generating a rise in exports of Class I material.China's imports of nickel by product 2020-2023INDONESIAN TRADE BOOMChina's trade with Indonesia was transformed after the latter banned exports of nickel ore at the start of 2020.China's NPI producers had been the main recipients of Indonesian ore and they responded by building processing capacity in Indonesia itself.Advertisement · Scroll to continueFlows of ore between the two countries all but disappeared to be replaced by NPI from the new Indonesian plants.Most of that material is ultimately destined for China's huge stainless steel sector and NPI remains the largest-volume category of trade between the two countries, growing by another 47% to 7.92 million metric tons in 2023.However, increasing amounts of capacity in Indonesia, much of it owned and operated by Chinese company, is now processing the country's laterite ore into other forms of nickel such as matte and MHP as a metallic route into precursor materials for batteries.Advertisement · Scroll to continueChina's imports of matte have mushroomed from just 10,800 tons in 2020 to 300,500 tons in 2023. Indonesian material accounted for 93% of last year's intake.Imports of MHP grew from 336,000 tons in 2020 to 1.32 million tons last year, of which 63% came from Indonesia.The exponential growth in this Sino-Indonesian trade reflects the continuing boom in Indonesian production that followed the country's ban on exports of unprocessed ore.Advertisement · Scroll to continueMined production jumped by 48% from 2021 to 2022 and by another 29% in the first 11 months of 2023, according to the International Nickel Study Group. Indonesia now accounts for over half of global production, compared with a third in 2019.China's trade in Class I refined nickelREFINED METALChina has historically been a significant net importer of refined nickel to cover the gap between the country's relatively small refining sector and its burgeoning demand.Advertisement · Scroll to continueHowever, the ever-rising flow of Indonesian nickel intermediate materials has significantly damped import demand for Class I high-purity metal.Last year's imports of 91,000 tons were down by 42% on 2022 levels and the lowest annual tally since 2005.But the real game-changer in China's Class I trade patterns has been rising exports of refined metal.China has occasionally flipped to net exporter in the past but only briefly and in reaction to one-off events.The Qingdao port scandal of 2014, which involved multiple pledging of metal being used as collateral in financing deals, generated a mass exit of nickel, copper and aluminium from bonded warehouses to safe-haven storage in other countries.Net imports of refined nickel slumped to just 16,000 tons that year, which was the lowest annual total since the start of the century.Exports in recent months, by contrast, have been moving higher without any external pull.Rather, this outbound flow reflects a new generation of Chinese plants converting intermediate product to refined metal, a processing breakthrough that is closing the gap between Class I and Class II nickel.December's exports totalled 7,520 tons, the highest monthly total since October 2019, when metal was drawn out of China by a ferocious short squeeze on the London Metal Exchange.The combination of lower imports and increased outbound flows reduced China's net imports to 55,000 tons in 2023, the second lowest annual count this century.EMERGING SULPHATE MARKETChinese operators are not just converting Indonesian ore into refined metal. They are also transforming it into nickel sulphate, which is the form of the metal used as a battery input.China has lifted imports of sulphate in line with its expanding battery capacity. The two main traditional suppliers were Finland and South Korea.That changed last year with imports from Indonesia jumping from zero to 60,000 tons.But China is now also producing sulphate in the domestic market with exports ticking steadily higher. Outbound flows are still small relative to what is arriving every month but total sulphate exports leapt from just 2,000 tons in 2022 to 17,000 tons last year.It seems quite possible that just as the processing and price disconnect between Class I and Class II nickel narrows, a whole new sulphate sub-market is starting to take shape.That may have ramifications for nickel's already problematic pricing model. But it underlines to what extent Indonesia's nickel trade with China is defining the global nickel market.The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for ReutersEditing by David EvansOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabOpinions expressed are those of the author.

REUTERS/Thomas Peter Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tabPurchase Licensing Rights , opens new tabThe body might go some way to addressing criticisms against SBTi’s role as both standard setter and verifier, a service for which it charges a fee. This apparent conflict of interest is highlighted in a letter sent last September to the U.S. House of Representatives’ Committee on Science, Space and Technology by Bill Baue, senior director of the not-for-profit platform r3.0 and a long-time critic of SBTi.“[SBTI is] a SBT (science-based target) standard setter that also serves as a SBT validator with a business model tied to validation growth, whose private interest thus diverges from the public interest, as it seeks to ‘keep the customer satisfied,’” Baue’s submission states.SBTi’s move anticipates a major review of SBTi’s corporate net-zero standard during the course of 2024, the first of its kind since its launch three years ago.In an attempt to underline its openness to feedback, SBTi has also recently appointed a compliance director, whose mandate, among other tasks, includes establishing a robust system for processing “complaints, allegations and appeals” by participating companies.Beyond the grumbling of individual brands, however, there’s a wider complaint around the general transparency of SBTi’s calculations and decision-making process.A comment piece , opens new tab published in the journal Nature Climate Change last year accused the organisation and its participating companies of “rarely” disclosing the inputs used to determine brands’ individual climate targets.comment piece , opens new tab“This makes it almost impossible to reproduce SBTs and verify or refute SBTi’s claim of a scientific basis,” the article states.It is a charge that SBTi vehemently refutes. “Unlike most other voluntary climate initiatives that define best practice without a mechanism to assess conformance, the SBTi’s target validation provides comprehensive assessment of submitted targets,” a spokesman told The Ethical Corporation.Validated companies are also obliged under SBTi’s official criteria , opens new tab to publicly disclose their greenhouse gas inventories and target progress on an annual basis, the spokesperson added. Stakeholders can “easily cross reference” with the information published on SBTi’s target dashboard , opens new tab .official criteria , opens new tabSBTi’s target dashboard , opens new tabHowever, brands can also have their commitments marked as removed from the dashboard if they are judged to have fallen short, a sanction meted out to 186 companies since the initiative’s inception, including high-profile firms such as Amazon, Eurostar, Kohl’s, Vale, and Yahoo Japan.U.S. e-retailer Amazon blamed its removal in August last year on changes in SBTi’s submission requirements. Going forwards, it said it would seek to set science-based targets “with other organisations and credible third-party validators”.Nevertheless, Galvin at CDP does not anticipate SBTi weakening its removal policy any time soon. If anything, with emissions “creeping up”, it should get stricter, he argues.It is ludicrous to suggest business is meeting its full obligations in the fight against climate change, he insists: “They (SBTi) need to stick to their guns on these things … the job of the Science Based Targets initiative is to constantly raise the bar.”It is one of the few points on which both SBTi and its critics can concur.Opinions expressed are those of the author.

Two former prime ministers of Italy are on separate missions with the same goal: to revive the European Union’s competitiveness. Mario Draghi and Enrico Letta are crisscrossing the continent meeting with business leaders, bureaucrats, and bankers. Yet to have any chance of succeeding, they will need to persuade European citizens a revamped bloc can work for their benefit.business leadersFor all the handwringing about Europe’s lack of competitive edge, the shortfall is hard to discern in economic data. Per-capita GDP in the EU is about 30% lower than in the United States, when measured on a purchasing power parity basis. Yet that’s partly because Europeans work fewer hours than Americans – and the gap is broadly stable. Nor is the EU obviously a trade laggard. For the past decade it has consistently maintained a collective current account surplus of more than 2% of GDP with the rest of the world, except in 2022, after Russia invaded Ukraine. Europeans also live longer.Reuters GraphicsNevertheless, Europe faces daunting external challenges. When the EU launched its single market in 1993, lowering barriers to trade, movement of labour, and capital flows across the continent, it was following the prevailing free-market orthodoxy. Three decades on, the world looks vastly different. The United States has deployed tariffs and sanctions to restrict cross-border trade. Tensions with China, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the fallout from the war in Ukraine have prompted governments and companies to reconsider global supply chains. This shift affects an open economy like the EU more than others.Advertisement · Scroll to continueEnergy is a particular weak spot. Russia’s attack on Ukraine exposed Europe’s dependence on imported gas. Though the bloc has quickly shifted to other suppliers of hydrocarbons, the upheaval has pushed up the price of power, prompting industrial groups to shift production elsewhere. While the crisis has spurred investment in renewable power, this transition will take decades.European business leaders also fret about the continent’s dependence on overseas technology. Most advanced semiconductors come from Asia, particularly Taiwan. Despite the European Commission’s efforts to regulate and rein in tech giants, the likes of Microsoft (MSFT.O) , opens new tab , Alphabet (GOOGL.O) , opens new tab and Amazon.com (AMZN.O) , opens new tab dominate. “When I move data to the cloud I have a choice of three American suppliers,” says a European bank CEO.

President Joe Biden has unleashed generous subsidies to stimulate American manufacturing, boost local production of semiconductors, and attract green technology. The EU lacks the coordinated fiscal firepower to respond. European companies are gratefully pocketing U.S. subsidies. Investment dollars are flowing elsewhere.

Its architects, led by the late Jacques Delors, wanted to create a level playing field across the continent. Strict rules prevented rich governments from favouring local firms. The EU suspended that regime during the pandemic and has struggled to reintroduce it as states supported power suppliers stricken by spiking gas prices and handed out subsidies to green energy producers. Between March 2022 and August 2023, the Commission approved state support schemes worth 733 billion euros , opens new tab , according to the Financial Times. That rivals the sums being spent across the Atlantic – but pits European governments against each other.worth 733 billion euros , opens new tabAdvertisement · Scroll to continueWhen it comes to addressing the EU’s problems, proposals fall into two broad categories. The first is to deregulate. Business leaders point to the lengthy approval processes required to clean up industrial facilities or get new drugs onto the market. “We have the oldest industries in the world and the most regulations,” sighs one European boss. Competition rules are a particular bugbear. The Commission has spent 18 months examining the merger of French telecoms group Orange’s (ORAN.PA) , opens new tab Spanish operations with rival MásMóvil, which would reduce the number of mobile operators in the country from four to three. Frustrated executives point out that China, whose population is 30 times the size of Spain’s, has just three major operators.(ORAN.PA) , opens new tabrival MásMóvilYet even as they complain about red tape in Brussels, companies are also pushing for more centralised decision-making, particularly on finance. The single market has failed to lower national barriers in banking, limiting the scope for cross-border competition. The EU’s attempts to unlock financial flows through a capital markets union have been a flop, in part because governments and national regulators are reluctant to give up power.It is up to the former Italian premiers to resolve these contradictions. Letta is due to deliver his conclusions in the next few months; Draghi’s recommendations will follow later in the year. Yet perhaps their biggest challenge is finding a way to enthuse EU voters. In the 1990s, leaders sold the single market as improving choice and opportunity for ordinary Europeans. These days the audience is more sceptical. Citizens fret about immigration. Small and medium-sized businesses are concerned about larger rivals. Consolidation could raise prices for consumers. European farmers are protesting about green regulations.are protestingPoliticians have tapped into the anti-Brussels mood: Geert Wilders, whose far-right Freedom Party won last year’s Dutch election, ran on a manifesto that included a promise to hold a referendum on EU membership. The Alternative for Germany and Marine Le Pen’s National Rally in France, which according to polls will pick up seats in June’s election for the European Parliament, have a eurosceptic streak.Europeans may yet accept the benefits of reform, as a way of ensuring greater collective security in a less friendly world. A revamped EU-wide industrial policy could help to create or preserve jobs in left-behind regions. A faster shift to green energy would improve air quality as well as reducing dependence on imported gas. To have any chance of success, though, the Italian Job of boosting competitiveness will have to start with EU citizens.Follow @peter_tl , opens new tab on X@peter_tl , opens new tab(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

With a date so far in the future, allowing many more years of clearance, there could be much less left to protect.""Advertisement · Scroll to continueHowever, Jose Pugas, partner and head of responsible investment for Brazilian asset manager JGP, takes a more optimistic stance. He said in an interview at COP28 that he was encouraged by progress by leading agricultural companies on deforestation-free soy, with one of the traders, Cargill, vowing in November to extend its commitment to cotton, wheat and corn in Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay.Pugas said there’s also been progress on deforestation related to the beef industry, which is alone responsible for 37% of the country’s emissions , opens new tab . Although not reported by international media, he said, one of Brazil’s big three beef exporters, Marfrig, announced at COP28 that it would bring forward plans to control 100% of its direct and indirect livestock supply chain, in all Brazil’s biomes, from the initial target of 2030 to 2025.37% of the country’s emissions , opens new tabAdvertisement · Scroll to continue“I’m optimistic that more and more, companies and farmers that are still dependent on deforestation for soy production, for beef production, for any kind of production, will find there is no market for them,” Pugas said.The availability of technology to trace the origins of commodities in their supply chains means companies can be held accountable, he said, and added that it is increasingly difficult for them to claim that they are complying with national legislation that permits them to legally deforest. “There is very clear pressure that zero-deforestation is zero-deforestation, not zero illegal deforestation,” he said.Still, Minerva, another of the big three, has made no deforestation commitment. And there has been a storm of controversy over the application by JBS, the world’s biggest producer of animal protein, to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.

Global Canopy’s latest Deforestation Action Tracker , opens new tab found that just 10% of institutional investors with climate commitments have a deforestation policy in place for these high-risk commodities.Deforestation Action Tracker , opens new tabYet Niki Mardas, executive director of Global Canopy, said in an interview he believes investors will no longer be able to close their eyes to the issue, most crucially due to regulators in key markets cracking down on imports of goods linked to deforestation.This is a reference to the EU’s Deforestation Regulation, which will apply to companies trading in cattle, cocoa, coffee, oil palm, rubber, soya and wood from 2025, and similar legislation proposed in the UK and the U.S.“I think it becomes an unavoidable issue. And while those regulations don't currently apply to the finance sector, they have deep implications for the companies that are invested in by these financial institutions and create risks that aren't fully understood that well, either by the companies themselves, but even less well by those that invest in them,” said Mardas.An agent of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) inspects a tree extracted from the Amazon rainforest, in a sawmill during an operation to combat deforestation, in Placas, Para State, Brazil.

Environment Programme’s latest State of Finance for Nature report, , opens new tab which Global Canopy co-authored. That is 30 times more than the $200 billion in finance flows to nature-based solutions.State of Finance for Nature report, , opens new tabAccording to the report, finance flows to nature-based solutions must almost triple to reach $542 billion per year by 2030 and $737 billion by 2050 if the world is to achieve global climate and biodiversity goals.Global Canopy is hoping that a new tool will help unblock one of the biggest barriers that have prevented companies and investors to make progress on deforestation pledges: the confusing data landscape.In the runup to COP28, Global Canopy, the Stockholm Environment Institute and the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) launched Forest IQ , opens new tab , an open platform that promises to provide “actionable data” on how more than 2,000 major companies are addressing their links to deforestation.Forest IQ , opens new tabForest IQ aggregates more than 2,400 data points across seven datasets, including Global Canopy’s Forest 500 list, Trase, ZSL SPOTT, and the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).An aerial view shows a deforested plot of the Amazon rainforest in Manaus, Amazonas State, Brazil.

None of us are data scientists so we don’t know how to do it and I am really grateful that this tool will help us get there more quickly.”Mardas said the next step will be to launch a new initiative, called deforestation-free transition pathways, later this year, “which will help move companies along the journey in a predictable and scientifically sensible way,” while avoiding greenwash issues surrounding deforestation commitments.“We get around the confusion problem (for companies) because it's a much more ordered framework, and we get around the greenwash problem because we're saying that ‘if you're a stage three company, we expect you to do X and Y and Z and we can have indicators for X,Y and Z, so we can know within 12 months whether you actually did those things.”He added: “The idea is to then link in with transition pathways on climate and nature as a kind of currency and language that the market understands.”Investors and policymakers have to get a wiggle on, Mardas adds. The next two years will be critical, with COP30 due to be held in Belem, in the heart of the Amazon. President Lula da Silva wants to show the world he’s made headway on his promises to end deforestation and transform the economy into a nature-friendly economy.But he faces a battle to push through his agenda in a Congress that is still friendly to the former president Jair Bolsonaro, Mardas said. “A lot of our thinking and a lot of our work is now focused on how can the world’s biggest rainforest nation play a pivotal leading role (on ending deforestation) on a time-track to COP 30.”Opinions expressed are those of the author.

The company paid $2.1 million in 2015 to settle a lawsuit brought by bar exam takers who couldn’t upload their test answers—an incident that became known as “barmageddon” in legal publications.A spokesperson for ExamSoft parent company Turnitin on Wednesday said that it ""continues to provide bar exam services"" to states, and declined to comment further.ExamSoft's software also came under scrutiny during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many states administered the exam remotely using laptop microphones and cameras to monitor for cheating. Some July 2021 examinees across the country had their computers crash mid-test. An investigation by the State Bar of California found that nearly 31% of the people who took the state’s remote exam experienced tech issues, and 2% lost time or answers as a result.

""But the platform element is what makes it more interesting than if they launched a TV. It can be productivity. It can be social. ... It could become a much bigger deal and a much bigger opportunity than if it were just a TV.""To be sure, the pricey Vision Pro will not be a quick best-seller. In a note to investors, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said Apple has told its supply chain to expect to build only 1 million units - and even that might be Apple preparing excess capacity ahead of consumer demand.Apple’s approach “suggests a lack of confidence that consumers will feel compelled to buy immediately without needing to be convinced by in-store demos,” Sacconaghi wrote.But the high price presents less of a barrier to business purchasers.Jay Wright, chief executive of Campfire, a startup that makes software for using headsets to collaborate remotely on three-dimensional files such as engine designs, noted that the original Mac computer in 1984 cost the equivalent of nearly $7,500 today. But small businesses flocked to the Mac for its ability to create and print documents and brochures.“It's important to recognize this is not a consumer accessory device, like Apple Watch. This is a whole new computing platform,” Wright said. “I'm of the opinion that this is more like what comes after the Mac than what comes after the iPhone.”Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco and Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Editing by Peter Henderson, Lisa Shumaker and Diane CraftOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabPurchase Licensing Rights"

https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/how-north-korean-eyelashes-make-their-way-west-made-china-2024-02-03/,How North Korean eyelashes make their way to West as 'made in China',By Ju-min Park and Eduardo Baptista,"February 3, 2024",T,"SEOUL/PINGDU, China, Feb 03 (Reuters) - Millions of dollars in sales of North Korean false eyelashes - marketed in beauty stores around the world as ""made in China"" - helped drive a recovery in the secretive state's exports last year.The processing and packaging of North Korean false eyelashes - openly conducted in neighbouring China, the country's largest trading partner - gives Kim Jong Un's regime a way to skirt international sanctions, providing a vital source of foreign currency.Advertisement · Scroll to continueReuters spoke to 20 people - including 15 in the eyelash industry, as well as trade lawyers and experts on North Korea's economy - who described a system in which China-based firms import semi-finished products from North Korea, which are then completed and packaged as Chinese.The finished eyelashes are then exported to markets including the West, Japan and South Korea, according to eight people who work for companies directly involved in the trade.Advertisement · Scroll to continueSome of the people spoke on condition that only their last names be used because they were not authorised to talk to the media.North Korea has long been a major exporter of hair products like wigs and false lashes, which enable people to avoid the hassle of mascara and to achieve a dramatic look. But exports tumbled during the COVID-19 pandemic, when North Korea slammed its borders tightly shut.Significant trade in North Korea-made lashes via China resumed in 2023, according to customs documents and four people in the industry.Advertisement · Scroll to continueChinese customs data showed that North Korea's exports to China more than doubled in 2023, when borders reopened. China is the destination for nearly all of North Korea's declared exports.Reuters Graphics Reuters GraphicsWigs and eyelashes comprised almost 60% of declared North Korean exports to China last year. In total, North Korea exported 1,680 tonnes of false eyelashes, beards and wigs to China in 2023, worth around $167 million.Advertisement · Scroll to continueIn 2019, when prices were lower, it exported 1,829 tonnes at a value of just $31.1 million.The U.S. State Department and international experts estimate that North Korea seizes up to 90% of foreign income generated by its citizens, many of whom live in poverty. Reuters was unable to determine how much of the revenue from eyelash sales flowed back to Kim's government, or how it was used.""We have to assume that ... millions of dollars every month that North Korea is making through this eyelash trade is being used for the Kim Jong Un regime,"" said Seoul-based sanctions lawyer Shin Tong-chan. His view was corroborated by two other international trade experts, though none provided specific evidence.North Korea did not respond to requests for comment for this story sent to its U.N. missions in New York and Geneva, its embassy in Beijing and its consular office in the Chinese border city of Dandong.A spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Beijing and Pyongyang ""are friendly neighbors"" and that ""normal cooperation between the two countries that is lawful and compliant should not be exaggerated.""U.N. AND U.S. SANCTIONSSince 2006, the United Nations Security Council has sought to stall Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme through nearly a dozen sanctions resolutions that restrict its ability to trade products such as coal, textiles and oil. It also imposed strict restrictions on North Koreans working abroad.Sanctions passed by the Security Council are supposed to be enforced by U.N. member states - all of whom are legally bound to implement them - using local legislation.But there is no direct ban on hair products, so trading false eyelashes from North Korea does not necessarily violate international law, three sanctions experts told Reuters.Reuters presented its findings to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, which said it was ""not aware of the circumstances"" described but that any alleged violations of U.N. sanctions are ""completely without foundation"".Japan's foreign ministry did not comment on Reuters' findings, but said Tokyo, which bans trade with Pyongyang, would continue to consider ""the most effective approach"" toward North Korea. The European Union's diplomatic service did not return requests for comment on North Korean-made eyelashes being sold in its jurisdiction.The United States has since 2008 separately expanded its own measures against North Korea, which include sanctions on any company stocking or selling products whose sales fund the Kim regime: a restriction that also applies to non-American firms using the U.S. dollar.But there are practical and political limitations on Washington's ability to enforce such sanctions unilaterally on entities such as foreign businesses that have minimal exposure to the U.S. financial system and don't sell primarily to American clients, according to two international sanctions lawyers.A U.S. Treasury spokesperson said it ""actively enforces the range of our broad North Korea sanctions authorities against both U.S. and foreign firms"" and would ""continue to aggressively target any revenue generation efforts"" by Pyongyang.The Treasury also referenced its nearly $1 million settlement with e.l.f. Cosmetics in 2019 over allegations that the U.S.-based firm inadvertently sold false eyelashes containing materials from North Korea.e.l.f.'s parent company said in a 2019 filing that it discovered two suppliers had used North Korean materials during a ""routine, self-administered audit"" and that it quickly addressed the issue, which it determined was ""not material.""The company, which has since stopped selling false eyelashes, reiterated its commitment to making products legally and responsibly in a statement to Reuters for this story.Reuters was unable to establish whether any Western companies are currently involved in the North Korean eyelash trade.CHINA'S 'EYELASH CAPITAL OF THE WORLD'[1/5]Workers work on a production line manufacturing false eyelashes at a workshop of Monsheery, in Pingdu, Shandong province, China November 16, 2023. REUTERS/Tingshu Wang Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab[1/5]Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tabThe people involved in the industry said that Pingdu, an eastern Chinese town that bills itself the 'eyelash capital of the world', is a key node in the supply chain from North Korea.Many Pingdu-based companies, such as Monsheery, package false eyelashes that are produced primarily by North Koreans, said Wang Tingting, whose family owns the firm, which exports products to the U.S., Brazil and Russia.Wang said in an interview from her factory that North Korean goods had helped build Monsheery up from a small family workshop. The company was founded in 2015, corporate records show.""The quality of the North Korean product is much better,"" said Wang, who said that she was not aware of any sanctions-related issues with using North Korean false eyelashes. She declined to name her international clients.Others in Pingdu said they are conscious of the role sanctions play in the complicated distribution chain.""If not for these sanctions, there would be no need for (North Koreans) to export through China,"" said Gao, who owns Yumuhui Eyelash.Cui Huzhe, who represents a North Korean factory that works with a Chinese partner in a venture called the Korea-China Processing Joint Trading Company, said the North Korean firm sends semi-finished eyelashes to China, where they are sold to markets including the U.S., Europe, Japan and South Korea.He declined to identify the two companies involved in the partnership or their clients. Subsequently, he couldn't be reached for comment on the sanctions implications.INCOME FOR A CASH-STRAPPED STATEChinese manufacturers began working with North Korean eyelash plants in the early 2000s, according to three Chinese factory managers. They said they prize the country's labour force for its low cost and the high quality of the eyelashes.About 80% of Pingdu's eyelash factories purchase or process false eyelash raw materials and semi-finished products from North Korea, according to a 2023 estimate published by Kali, a Chinese manufacturer of eyelash boxes, on its website.Pingdu's government says the town of roughly 1.2 million accounts for 70% of global output of false eyelashes, which are often made of synthetic fibres but may also be created from mink fur or human hair.Trading company Asia Pacific International Network Technology, based in the Chinese border city of Hunchun, advertises on its website the services of three North Korean eyelash processing factories with images of workers arranging hairs and pasting them on paper.Reached by phone, a company employee, who would not give her name, declined to comment.Seoul-based businessman Johny Lee imports products like chicken-feet shaped lashes used for extensions through Dandong into South Korea.Those lashes are made by North Koreans, packaged in China, and then sold locally or exported to Asian countries like Japan, said Lee, who chairs a trade group in Seoul that includes eyelash extension technicians from the West and South Korea.Asked about legal risks, Lee - who began sourcing eyelashes from China a decade ago - said he was not selling ""sophisticated technology like semiconductors."" North Korean workers ""are trying to make a living there,"" he said.South Korean law states that if two or more countries are involved in the production of imported goods, the place where the products gained ""essential characteristics"" will be deemed the country of origin.Reuters described how eyelashes made by North Korean workers are packaged and completed in China to Shin Min-ho, a South Korea-certified customs attorney. He said North Korea would likely be considered their country of origin because it gave the raw materials ""essential characteristics.""Seoul's Korea Customs Services said that ""importing North Korean products disguised as Chinese can be punished,"" but that it was ""difficult to determine"" country of origin based solely on Reuters' description of the supply chain between North Korea and China and that it was not investigating the issue.GOOD QUALITY, CHEAP SALARIESDespite the quality of the eyelashes, North Korean labour is poorly paid.

Their outlines are thousands of pages long, with complex instructions and numerous incompatible versions that can only be modified by their developers.Advertisement · Scroll to continueRISC-V is free to use and has a simpler outline, often leading to more energy-efficient chips, and users can build atop the framework to suit their needs.Half of the more than 10 billion RISC-V chips shipped globally by 2022 were made in China, the state-run China Daily reported in August. Bao Yungang, deputy director of China's Institute of Computing Technology, told a chip conference last June that funding for RISC-V startups in China had reached at least $1.18 billion to that point.""The RISC-V ecosystem in China is the most mature globally"", a result of the need of government and industry to develop technology that can circumvent U.S. sanctions, said a sales representative from a Beijing-based company that develops RISC-V chips, who was not authorised to speak publicly.Some 1,061 patents involving RISC-V were published in China last year, up from 10 in 2018, Anaqua's AcclaimIP database shows. While the U.S. saw a similar increase, 2,508 such patents have been published in China, to the U.S.'s 2,018.Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Huawei, neither of which responded to requests for comment, were the fourth- and fifth-largest filers.Arm is the dominant architecture in China, so RISC-V is a long-term bet to insure Beijing against a scenario in which Arm is forced to not just halt licensing to Huawei, as it did temporarily in 2019, but to all Chinese companies.While the performance of RISC-V chips lags Arm in complex computing tasks, the gap is closing as RISC-V startups proliferate and more tech companies invest in the open-source standard, said Richard Wawrzyniak, principal analyst at the SHD Group, a market research firm.'TRUE RISE TO POWER'RISC-V technology emerged last decade from labs at the University of California, Berkeley.A few months after Huawei was blacklisted by the Trump administration in May 2019, RISC-V International, a non-profit foundation that oversees development of the standard, moved its headquarters from Delaware to Switzerland.Calista Redmond, CEO of RISC-V International, told Reuters the move was not to ""circumvent any legal restriction by any government"" but ""to ensure continued ecosystem growth of the open standard for years to come"".Still, the foundation says on its website that the move alleviated uncertainty as there was concern from the RISC-V community ""across 2018-2019"" related to the geopolitical landscape, without mentioning China.Reuters reported in October that some U.S. lawmakers were urging the Biden administration to impose export restrictions around RISC-V, a move that Redmond has said would slow the development of new and better chips.reportedslow the developmentThe U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry Security declined to comment.For China, there has been a geopolitical incentive to invest in the emerging standard.In 2019, researchers at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China organised a seminar on how RISC-V could help China achieve tech self-sufficiency.""Everyone agreed…if domestic chip systems want to get rid of the limitations of x86 and ARM architectures and realise a true rise to power, RISC-V will be the biggest opportunity,"" says a summary of the seminar published on the university's website.Among recent breakthroughs in China, state-owned car maker Dongfeng Motor Corporation last year developed an automotive MCU chip, used to control the electronic systems of a car, using RISC-V.Dongfeng and China's Ministry of Science and Technology did not respond to requests for comment.MILITARY INTERESTUniversities and research institutes linked to China's military have also developed and promoted RISC-V in recent years, Reuters' review found.The PLA-run National University of Defense Technology was in the top 15 for RISC-V patents filed in China since 2018, according to AcclaimIP, as was Peng Cheng Laboratory, which has partnerships with at least two defence-related institutes.At an academic conference in November 2022, researchers at Beihang University, whose scientists are involved in the development of Chinese military aircraft and missiles, presented the design for a RISC-V chip that processes radar signals.The year prior, researchers at the Institute of Software at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), a state think tank, co-developed a RISC-V chip to prevent a type of cyberattack. The institute is a PLA supplier, government tenders show.In May 2023, the CAS Institute of Computing Technology, which is under U.S. sanctions, unveiled the second generation of ""Xiangshan"", a RISC-V high-performance PC chip, and ""Aolai"", a RISC-V operating system.Interest from the Chinese institutes and universities, which did not respond to queries, echoes investment in RISC-V research labs and companies a decade ago by the U.S. government's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.An agency spokesperson said that while it did not directly fund the development of the RISC-V architecture, it funded efforts that used RISC-V to ""create prototype chips and test research hypotheses in the interests of U.S. national security"".Despite its promise, RISC-V so far has not broken x86 and Arm's dominance. The SHD Group estimated that 1.9% of all system-on-a-chip units shipped in 2022 had a RISC-V processor.But with demand for AI chips growing, RISC-V's low cost, ease of customisation and energy efficiency have made it attractive to some chipmakers.Original equipment manufacturers ""want to develop highly customized cores. And RISC-V really fits that bill,"" Ziad Asghar, Qualcomm's senior vice president of product management, said in an interview published on the company's website in September.($1 = 7.1497 Chinese yuan renminbi)Reporting by Eduardo Baptista and Beijing newsroom; editing by David CrawshawOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabPurchase Licensing Rights"

Users will leave the platform if they feel safety is compromised – be it their children’s or their own. Plus social media firms like Meta are meant to be at the cutting edge of technology. Suggesting that they can’t keep it clean is a poor reflection of their software prowess.Advertisement · Scroll to continueFurther, this issue could soon become a political hot button, which will only get messier for Meta. It’s a bad look for either political party in an election year to exhibit dysfunction around such an important topic. That could make Meta a punching bag in the upcoming U.S. presidential election, especially as suburban voters in key areas drill down on issues that relate to families. Rhetorical backlash against Meta could become politically expedient, and a new Washington guard might take a much harder line.

Barabander and Lucille Dai-He","February 2, 2024",S,"CompaniesLaw FirmsOpenAi Inc.OpenAi Inc.FollowFebruary 2, 2024 - Although ChatGPT was not designed solely for the task of summarization, its generative AI capabilities have incidentally made it a useful tool for prompting summaries of text and concepts. This summarization capability is a focal point in the recent suit Silverman v. OpenAI, Inc., 3:23-cv-03416, (N.D. Cal.), in which plaintiffs, all authors of books, are suing OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, claiming that OpenAI had infringed these authors' copyrights by using their works to train GPT, the model underlying ChatGPT.This case is among several recent cases that have drawn intense interest because the claims test the bounds of copyright law as it relates to the use of copyrighted works to train a machine learning model.The case raises several factual issues, most critically, how GPT was trained. To make their claim, the plaintiffs must prove that their copyrighted works were actually ingested by GPT during the training process, and that this ingestion constitutes infringing activity.Advertisement · Scroll to continueRegarding whether the copyrighted works were actually ingested by GPT during training, what data exactly was used in training is not publicly documented, so we are unable to know for certain from where GPT learned this information.It is worth discussing what summarization means in the context of a user's experience of the service. Generally speaking, there are two different ways users can prompt ChatGPT to generate summaries. First, the user can type in a summarization command and then paste in the text she wants summarized (e.g., ""summarize this: [pasted content]""). Second, the user can type in a summarization command without providing the thing to be summarized (e.g., ""summarize historical scholarship on the war of 1812""). We will refer to the first type as an ""in-context summary"" and the second type as an ""out-of-context summary.""Advertisement · Scroll to continueBoth types of summaries are generated by the model using the same function. GPT is an ""autoregressive language model,"" which means it generates outputs one ""token"" (generally, a word or part of a word) at a time, repeatedly using the ""context"" of the previous tokens, including the prompt, to produce the best next token. It uses a mechanism called ""attention"" to determine which tokens in the context to focus on.Advertisement · Scroll to continueAs a loose analogy for how this attention mechanism works, imagine a human author writing a paper, but before each new word is typed, the author rereads the previous words typed and focuses on the words that are important for the meaning of the word that is about to be typed. The GPT model's objective is always to generate the next best token to follow the sequence of words in the context, regardless of whether the user's prompt includes the text to be summarized, or merely a reference to some outside concept.Advertisement · Scroll to continueYet, because the GPT model attends to context that the user provides in her prompt (along with other background context that we will not discuss in this article), the two types of summary prompts can lead to different inferences about the data GPT uses to reach its next token prediction.When ChatGPT is asked to produce an in-context summary, the model has as its context both the command (e.g., ""summarize this text:"") and the excerpted text to be summarized. This means the model applies its attention mechanism to the actual text it is asked to summarize. As a consequence, the model identifies information from the text, which it can use to produce the summary output. Thus, if ChatGPT produces an accurate summary in the in-context scenario, it is difficult to know what information in the summary is informed by training data versus the text in the user's prompt.This differs from when ChatGPT is prompted to produce an out-of-context summary, which is the type of summary the plaintiffs are relying on to make their claims, which include an assertion that GPT ingested their books as part of training (and not that the book texts were inserted as part of a user's prompt). In an exhibit to the Complaint, the plaintiffs provide copies of prompts requesting summaries of plaintiffs' books and summaries, which they allege prove GPT was trained on the plaintiffs' works.For example, one prompt is: ""Summarize in detail the beginning of 'Sandman Slim' by [plaintiff] Richard Kadrey"" (and no other context is provided). ChatGPT responds, in part, as follows: ""The novel begins with the protagonist, James Stark, returning to Earth after 11 years of enforced residency in Hell, during which he was the only living human"". If this summary is accurate, as the plaintiffs claim (Compl. ¶ 42), where is that information coming from?A reasonable inference is that this information is captured somehow in the model's weights (parameters adjusted during training that affect the different levels of importance the model assigns to input features). Assuming the version of ChatGPT the plaintiffs used to produce these summaries did not retrieve content related to the books at runtime and consider it in its context, the only words the model is attending to at the outset are the words within the prompt — the request, the level of detail, the part of the book to summarize, the title of the book and the author — but this prompt does not provide any further information about the book itself. Put simply, the model is not directly attending to the text inside the book ""Sandman Slim"" because it was not part of the user's prompt.If the information in the summary is captured somehow in the model's weights, there is a further question of where this information came from. One possibility, cited by the plaintiffs, is that GPT was trained on the plaintiffs' copyrighted works. (Compl. ¶ 5.) As another possibility, GPT could have been trained on a large number of reviews or plot summaries found on the internet (not written by Kadrey) of Kadrey's book, including summaries that break down the book chapter by chapter (just as humans could provide a summary of a book without reading the actual book, simply through reading others' summaries of the book on the internet).In fact, 85% of GPT-3's training data originates from online content , opens new tab (Common Crawl, WebText2 and English- language Wikipedia datasets), so it is certainly possible these datasets contained accurate summaries of the books (not written by the plaintiffs) and that these were ingested during training.85% of GPT-3's training data originates from online content , opens new tabSilverman v. OpenAI is one of the first major copyright cases to claim that the generation of text based on a particular prompt request (e.g., summarization) can dispositively prove that certain data must have been ingested as part of the training process. Defendants have not sought dismissal at the pleading stage of the plaintiffs' allegations of direct copyright infringement, so these questions will be resolved at a later stage when Defendants can raise defenses such as fair use, as well as address the conclusions plaintiffs are drawing from the evidence presented.In navigating these questions of fact and law, knowledge of the function of the underlying technology is essential in order to understand what conclusions can — and cannot — be drawn with full confidence.Opinions expressed are those of the author.

https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/manipulating-reality-intersection-deepfakes-law-2024-02-01/,Manipulating reality: the intersection of deepfakes and the law,By Sara H. Jodka,"February 1, 2024",S,"Law FirmsDickinson Wright PLLCDickinson Wright PLLCFollowFebruary 1, 2024 - The use of artificial intelligence (""AI"") continues to expand, meaning the use of deepfake technology to create digital fabrications will necessarily follow. Deepfakes are synthetic media in which a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else's likeness using AI techniques. Deepfakes are incredibly realistic, making it difficult to distinguish between real versus manipulated media. This can and has led to impersonation, fraud, blackmail and the spread of misinformation and propaganda.As such, it is crucial to clearly understand deepfakes, the technology involved in creating them, and the legal challenges their use poses, especially privacy.The technology in creating deepfakesAt the core of deepfakes is AI, specifically a subset of machine learning called deep learning. Deep learning uses neural networks with many layers to analyze and interpret large data sets. Deepfakes are hyper-realistic digital fabrications, typically video or audio recordings, created using AI and machine learning techniques. They involve superimposing existing images and videos onto the source images or videos using a deep learning technique, particularly generative adversarial networks (""GANs"").Advertisement · Scroll to continueGANs involve two neural networks — a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates images/videos while the discriminator assesses them against the actual footage. Through iterative processes, the generator gets increasingly better at producing realistic fakes. This technology allows for creating convincingly realistic fake content that shows individuals saying or doing things they never actually did.Advertisement · Scroll to continueHow deepfakes are createdDeepfakes are created using a significant amount of data, including photos, soundbites, or videos of a target person. Because more data can create more convincing deepfakes, celebrities, politicians, and other public figures are the most common targets.The emergence of apps and online services where users can create deepfakes with minimal technical knowledge has further lowered the bar to entry.AI trains by using collected data to understand the subtleties and nuances of the target person, such as facial features, voice tone and inflections, and movements. The trained model then superimposes the target person's likeness onto a source photo or video. Video manipulations are done on a frame-by-frame basis to create a realistic video.Advertisement · Scroll to continueThe technology is so advanced it is becoming increasingly difficult to decipher between the original, authentic content and the deepfakes.High-profile cases involving deepfakes and privacy infringementHigh-profile cases involving deepfakes and privacy infringement have garnered significant attention in recent years, underscoring the severe implications of this technology. These cases often involve public figures and illustrate the potential for harm that deepfakes pose.Advertisement · Scroll to continueThe most relevant example of this is the recent publication of sexually explicit AI-generated images of Taylor Swift on X, which attracted more than 45 million views, 24,000 reposts, and hundreds of thousands of likes and bookmarks for nearly 17 hours before being shut down. Despite being eventually shut down, the images quickly spread and were reposted across accounts and social media platforms causing significant damage.This incident, and others like it, speak to the challenges in stopping deepfake pornography and AI-generated images of real people and in controlling and containing the damages.Ethical and privacy concernsDeepfake technology, with its ability to create hyper-realistic, forged videos and audio, presents novel and formidable challenges to existing privacy laws. These challenges arise because of the unique qualities of deepfakes and the current legal frameworks' inadequacies in addressing such advanced technological manipulations.Right to privacy and publicity lawsU.S. privacy laws vary by state, but some, like California's Right of Publicity Law, protect individuals from unauthorized use of their name, voice, signature, photograph, or likeness. These laws, however, were primarily designed to deal with commercial exploitation meaning that they may not fully cover non-commercial uses of deepfakes.Many jurisdictions require consent to an individual's likeness or personal data, but enforcing these consent requirements for deepfakes, especially when anonymously created, is challenging and infringes on an individual's right for someone to control their image and likeness.Social media and apps that allow photo and video sharing have complicated this claim, given that someone's image can be obtained through various consent mechanisms. There are two types of consent: expressed and implied.Expressed consent is an individual's clear, direct, and unambiguous agreement. In the social media/app context, consent can be obtained by taking an affirmative action to indicate consent, like checking a box. Implicit consent does not require an affirmative step and it is inferred through the user's actions. Through terms of use, implicit consent can be obtained by continued use of an app.The lack of clarity in defining consent, combined with deepfakes being used for defamatory, blackmail, and other nefarious purposes, as well as real-time impersonation that exposes avenues for novel privacy breaches — all in light of the anonymity and ease of creating and disseminating deepfakes that make it extremely difficult to identify the creators and hold them accountable — create a perfect storm for the misuse of this technology.As pointed out during the Screen Actors Guild strike, the use of AI technology in films, television, and other arts had been bubbling for a while. Concerns have been raised that the terms of use in acting contracts could be used to obtain consent for an AI-generated image of an actor, superimposing their likenesses for years without paying for their use. Further, if studios can use technology to replicate actors and artists, it will shrink opportunities for live actors and artists, crippling that trade. A recent issue of Netflix's ""Black Mirror"" could reveal the issue is not so far off, as it depicts an AI-generated likeness of Salma Hayek, as well as the real-life character she plays, Joan, signing their likeness rights away.The actors strike ended in December 2023 with a deal requiring companies to obtain consent before making digital replicas of actors. The consent further requires companies disclose what the replica will be used for, and actors must be compensated for use of their digital replicas. The deal also included guidelines around synthetic fake performers based on an actor's image and likeness, which is used to train generative AI.Defamation and false light lawsDeepfakes can depict individuals in compromising or harmful situations, potentially leading to significant reputational damage. The creation and dissemination of deepfakes can cause considerable emotional distress to the depicted individuals, especially if the content is defamatory, embarrassing, or violates their personal or professional ethics.If a deepfake falsely represents an individual in a defamatory manner, existing defamation laws can offer some recourse. However, the burden of proof lies with the victim, which can be difficult, especially in proving the falsity of deepfake content. Defamation and false light laws protect an individual from being defamed or presented in a false light, are primarily inapplicable, or offer little recourse given there is a high burden of proof, focusing on false statements rather than false images and videos.Cybercrime and harassmentLaws against cybercrimes may cover some aspects of deepfake creation and distribution, especially if they involve hacking or unauthorized access to personal data.In cases where deepfakes are used for harassment or stalking, existing laws in this domain might provide legal recourse for victims.Criminal laws are also inadequate as they do not explicitly cover the creation or distribution of deepfakes, other than to the extent they would fall under the traditional categories of cybercrimes or sexual offenses.Obscenity and pornography lawsLaws against non-consensual pornography are directly applicable in cases where deepfakes are used to create explicit content without the subject's consent. However, the enforcement of these laws can be complicated by jurisdictional issues and the anonymous nature of online content distribution.ConclusionThe reality is that common law torts, criminal statutes, and current legal frameworks were not built, and did not anticipate the creation of real-time, realistic digital replicas, which leaves significant gaps in the protection laws.For instance, traditional privacy laws might not cover the nuances of digital impersonation or may not provide adequate remedies. The global nature of the internet complicates enforcement of privacy rights as perpetrators exist beyond legal reach of the victim's country. In legal settings, proving that a video or audio recording is a deepfake can be challenging, especially as the technology becomes more sophisticated.As it becomes harder to authenticate the genuineness of such evidence, deepfakes can undermine the reliability of audiovisual material as evidence in legal proceedings. As courts deal with deepfake-related cases, developing precedents and case law will be crucial in this new legal minefield.Opinions expressed are those of the author.

https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/questions-swirl-over-future-ukraines-popular-iron-general-2024-01-31/,Questions swirl over future of Ukraine's popular 'Iron General',By Tom Balmforth,"February 1, 2024",F,"KYIV, Feb 1 (Reuters) - For Ukrainian armed forces commander General Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, even his status as national hero for leading the war effort against Moscow's invading forces is not enough to quash questions over whether he will keep his job.A series of Western and Ukrainian media reports said that President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had asked Zaluzhnyi to step aside this week, a request he declined.A source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday that ground forces commander Oleksandr Syrskyi had been offered Zaluzhnyi's job but turned it down.SyrskyiThe Ukrainian General Staff and president's office did not respond to requests for comment on the approach to Syrskyi.Ukrainian forces are currently struggling in the battlefield.A much-anticipated summer counteroffensive made little headway in the south and east, and Russian forces are inflicting small but costly defeats along the 1,000-km front.Western military and financial support is increasingly hard to come by, leaving Kyiv more exposed to regular attacks by Russian drones and missiles that are sapping its energy.Advertisement · Scroll to continueThe state of the war is not down to Zaluzhnyi alone, but given his popularity and proven ability as an inspiring commander, the fact that Kyiv may be seeking to replace him may reflect the desire for a fresh approach to the conflict.A HERO TO MANYDefying overwhelming odds, Ukraine's soldiers used stealth and speed to thwart Russia's advance on Kyiv, helping to ensure that, even now, Russian President Vladimir Putin remains a long way from conquering Ukraine.Advertisement · Scroll to continueAs the war progressed, Zaluzhnyi's stock only rose, and he won praise at home and abroad when his forces launched counteroffensives in the northeast and south that recaptured huge swathes of land and raised hopes of an unlikely victory.A portrait of him smiling and flashing the peace sign was spray-painted on walls after the liberation of the southern city of Kherson, under the slogan ""God and Zaluzhnyi are with us"".Advertisement · Scroll to continueSince then, Ukraine's battlefield momentum has stalled, yet polling indicated that Zaluzhnyi was still trusted by 92% of Ukrainians late last year, significantly above Zelenskiy's 77%.Reported frictions burst into the open in November after Zaluzhnyi was quoted by the Economist as saying the war as at a ""stalemate"", in a gloomy assessment that jarred with Zelenskiy's more optimistic vision.The 50-year-old four-star general, who rarely speaks in public but is occasionally shown on news bulletins poring over maps and addressing commanders in fatigues, argued that better technology is the key to breaking the impasse.Advertisement · Scroll to continueThe president's office rebuked him, and one of Zaluzhnyi's senior officers said he had been sacked by Zelenskiy over the general's head.Were he to be removed and go into politics - though he has never voiced political ambitions - the ""Iron General"" could prove a formidable rival to anyone.THE BURLY 'VOLUNTEER'Zaluzhnyi began his military training in the 1990s, after Ukraine gained independence from the Soviet Union, graduating with honours and rising up the ranks.He got a taste of real conflict in 2014 when he served in an area of eastern Ukraine where Russian-backed militants had seized territory.Tall and burly with cropped hair, Zaluzhnyi, whose military call sign is ""Volunteer"", has a reputation for having a good rapport with his subordinates and allowing local commanders to make their own decisions on the battlefield.To many, he felt like a breath of fresh air among Ukraine's older Soviet-style generals, and embodied Kyiv's desire to break with the Soviet military practices it had inherited.His warning in November that the war was sliding into an attritional phase that suited Russia was out of kilter with Kyiv's official rhetoric, but for many of his soldiers it was recognition of the painful reality on the battlefield.Russia had been building up fortifications since late 2022 after suffering humiliating defeats in Kharkiv and Kherson regions, with more recent Ukrainian advances thwarted.Tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed and wounded on both sides, although there are no reliable official figures.Ukraine desperately needs to replenish its overstretched and exhausted ranks, but the government has been unable to amend call-up laws to help recruit up to half a million more soldiers.Kyiv has also struggled to maintain Western support that has been vital to its war effort.The United States has failed to deliver a hefty aid package it had promised, although, in a boost for Ukraine, the European Union agreed on Thursday to extend $54 billion in new support, overcoming weeks of resistance from Hungary.agreedEven so, as the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War Two enters its third year, Zaluzhnyi's boots would be very hard to fill.Reporting by Tom Balmforth; editing by Mike Collett-White, Kevin Liffey and Ros RussellOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabPurchase Licensing Rights"

No question. But is it effective? Not as much as it could be. As any honest policymaker will admit, healthcare is facing a demand-supply mismatch. Too many ill people, not enough resources.Yet extra investment alone will not solve the problem. As a growing corpus of health insiders point out, unless people take proactive steps to protect their health, the pipeline of sick patients will only grow.Hence, the call for less “sick care” (as some critics refer to modern healthcare systems) and more preventative care. The economics bear this out. Every pound invested in keeping people healthy adds up to 15 pounds to the productive economy, independent research suggests.What’s true for sickness is true for climate.

REUTERS/Stephanie Keith Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tabPurchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab“The health sector as a whole has come to realise that, actually, we are so much more impactful when we collaborate and work collectively with people who have historically been our competitors,” she remarks.Pressed for an example of such collaboration, however, she concedes that these have yet to emerge at scale. She explains that this is due to the diversity of therapy areas and market reach.Respective capacity is also a limiting factor, she adds: “Partly, the reason is (that) every company is at a slightly different point in its technology journey ... so there isn't a universal silver bullet that says ‘this is the digital tool that can be applied’.”White hopes this might change through SMI’s efforts to establish a common framework to calculate emissions linked to patient-care pathways. A preliminary iteration of the protocol, which is being developed in conjunction with the UK’s National Health Service and the British Standards Institute, is expected later this year.Having consistent data will enable the sector’s main players to focus on areas of greatest carbon impact, she explains: “Having an aligned measurement system is really, really key because then we’re going to act on facts (and) do what science expects us to do.”Trade-offs will be inevitable on the road ahead. Immediate health priorities will, presumably, always trump longer-term climate concerns. Take low-carbon asthma inhalers, for example. Inhalers, which are used by 12 million people in the UK, account for 3% of the NHS’s carbon footprint because of the gas propellant inside them.As AstraZeneca concedes in a recent white paper , opens new tab , dry powder inhalers, which are propellant-free, may be less environmentally damaging but they may also not be appropriate for everyone and could therefore lead to “poorer asthma control”.recent white paper , opens new tabSimilarly, many preventative measures lie outside the hands of private healthcare companies, either because they rely on public investment (eg urban parks, cycle paths, etc) or private lifestyle choices (taking regular exercise, maintaining a healthy diet, etc).Yet there are far more synergies between climate change and health than not.

But it presented an opportunity for one man.Elon Musk - the owner of SpaceX, the world's most successful rocket launcher – seized on the failure to prevail over state-owned China Great Wall Industry Corp (CGWIC) as Jakarta's company of choice for putting satellites into space.The Chinese contractor had courted Indonesia - Southeast Asia's largest economy and a key space growth market - with cheap financing, promises of broad support for its space ambitions and the geopolitical heft of Beijing.A senior government official and two industry officials in Jakarta familiar with the matter told Reuters the malfunction marked a turning point for Indonesia to move away from Chinese space contractors in favour of companies owned by Musk.Advertisement · Scroll to continueNusantara-2 was the second satellite launch awarded by Indonesia to CGWIC, matching the two carried out by SpaceX at that time. Since its failure, SpaceX has launched two Indonesian satellites, with a third set for Tuesday; China has handled none.SpaceX edged out Beijing through a combination of launch reliability, cheaper reusable rockets, and the personal relationship Musk nurtured with Indonesian President Joko Widodo, Reuters found. Following a meeting between the two men in Texas in 2022, SpaceX also won regulatory approval for its Starlink satellite internet service.Advertisement · Scroll to continueThe SpaceX deals mark a rare instance of a Western company making inroads in Indonesia, whose telecommunications sector is dominated by Chinese companies that offer low costs and easy financing. The successes came after Indonesia resisted U.S. pressure to abandon its deals with Chinese tech giant Huawei, citing its dependence on Beijing's technology.U.S. pressureDetails of this shift, which were described to Reuters by a dozen people, including Indonesian and U.S. officials, industry players and analysts, have not previously been reported. Some of them spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorised to talk to media.Advertisement · Scroll to continue""SpaceX has never failed in launching our satellites,"" said Sri Sanggrama Aradea, head of the satellite infrastructure division at BAKTI, an Indonesian communications ministry agency.The April 2020 incident makes it ""hard"" for Jakarta to turn to CGWIC again, he added.SpaceX, CGWIC and Pasifik Satelit Nusantara - a key shareholder in the Nusantara-2 project - did not respond to questions for this story.Advertisement · Scroll to continueChina's Foreign Ministry said in response to Reuters questions that ""Chinese aerospace enterprises are continuing their space cooperation with Indonesia in various forms."" It did not elaborate.Presidential office spokesperson Ari Dwipayana said the government prioritises efficient and capable technology that meets the need of Indonesians when awarding contracts.The tussle between SpaceX and China offers a window into a much larger battle to dominate a rapidly expanding space industry.The global satellite market - including manufacturing, services and launches - was worth $281 billion in 2022, or 73% of all space business, according to U.S. consultancy BryceTech.SPACE RACEChina launched a record 67 rockets last year, out of 223 globally, according to a report by Harvard professor and orbital tracker Jonathan McDowell. The vast majority were launched by CGWIC.That put China only behind the United States, which had 109 launches, 90% of which were done by SpaceX, the report found.Washington and Beijing are also competing over satellite-based communications networks.SpaceX's Starlink, which owns around 60% of the roughly 7,500 satellites orbiting earth, is dominant in the satellite internet sphere. But, last year, China began launching satellites for its rival Guowang broadband mega-constellation.U.S. military officials have said China wants to use satellites and space technology to spy on rivals and increase military capabilities.China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement to Reuters the U.S. allegations were a smear and that Washington was using the concerns as a pretext to expand its influence in space.Unlike its Chinese counterpart, NASA relies primarily on privately owned rockets from firms such as SpaceX, which has billions of dollars in U.S. government contracts.But the U.S. government and military are concerned about their reliance on SpaceX, especially given Musk's muscular business style, according to one current and one former U.S. official working on space policy.While legacy U.S. defence contractors like Boeing (BA.N) , opens new tab and Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) , opens new tab typically consult the State Department before making foreign deals, Musk and SpaceX dealt directly with Jakarta, the two officials said.(BA.N) , opens new tab(LMT.N) , opens new tabIn response to Reuters' questions, a Lockheed Martin spokesperson said the company ""works closely with the U.S. Government, our allied nations and international customers"".

It's difficult to break China's dominance.""STARBASE MEETINGIn May 2022, Jokowi, as the powerful Indonesian president is popularly known, visited a SpaceX facility in Boca Chica, Texas.""Welcome to Starbase,"" Musk said, smiling and shaking hands with the president, who was seeking Tesla investment in Indonesia's nickel sector.Widodo's two-hour visit included 30 minutes of talks with Musk at an office packed with miniature rockets and then a tour of the production area, according to an Indonesian official with direct knowledge.The president has long sought to build an EV industry in Indonesia, which has the world's biggest reserves of nickel, a key element in electric batteries.

The plan made no headway - until the Boca Chica visit.""GAME CHANGER""Less than a month after the Texas meeting, Telkom announced its subsidiary had received Starlink landing rights.Indonesia's communication ministry told Reuters that Starlink is only permitted to operate a backhaul service with Telkomsat and that it does not have the right to retail consumer internet services.Musk ""put that ask on the table then and there, so things started,"" said the source with knowledge of Indonesian discussions, referring to the May meeting.Widodo's spokesperson, Dwipayana, confirmed that Musk and the president discussed opportunities in Indonesia, adding that officials are still in communication with the billionaire about future investments by his businesses, including Tesla.Telkom did not respond to requests for comment.Last June, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket pushed into orbit the 4.5-tonne Satellite of the Republic of Indonesia (SATRIA-1) - Southeast Asia's largest satellite.Southeast Asia's largest satelliteNia Satwika, a SATRIA-1 project manager, said SpaceX offered lower costs and had higher availability of launch slots when compared with other operators.""They are a game changer,"" she said, referring to SpaceX's ability to reuse parts of its rockets - a crucial cost advantage over rivals.reuse parts of its rocketsReporting by Stefanno Sulaiman, Devjyot Ghoshal and Joe Brock; Additional reporting by Joey Roulette and Joe Cash; Editing by Katerina AngOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabPurchase Licensing RightsDevjyot GhoshalThomson ReutersDevjyot reports on Southeast Asia, with a focus on business stories and those involving the nexus of money and power.

But he could have trouble finding a lender after Engoron ruled that he lied to banks about his wealth.The appeal could take more than a year, and it is not yet clear whether an appellate court would put Engoron's Friday decision on hold during the process.WHAT HAPPENS IF TRUMP FAILS TO PAY?If he exhausts his appeals and refuses to pay in the civil fraud case, Trump could be held in contempt of court and hit with additional fines. The state could also seek to garnish Trump's wages.

Two of Tesla's other current directors, Robyn Denholm and Ira Ehrenpreis, showed a lack of independence in the pay decision, she said.The board currently has eight members including its CEO.Ross Gerber, president and CEO at Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management and a Tesla investor, told Reuters the ruling showed the company needed to replace at least three directors with independent board members before it can negotiate a new pay package for Musk.""Essentially, the entire corporate structure of Tesla has been deemed, like not appropriate for a public company,"" Gerber said.Tesla directors argued during the trial that the company was paying to ensure one of the world's most dynamic entrepreneurs continued to dedicate his attention to the electric vehicle maker. Antonio Gracias, a Tesla director from 2007 to 2021, called the package ""a great deal for shareholders"".Tornetta's lawyers argued the Tesla board never told shareholders the goals were easier to achieve than the company was acknowledging and that internal projections showed Musk was quickly going to qualify for large portions of the pay package.TornettaThe plaintiff's legal team also argued the board had a duty to offer a smaller pay package or look for another CEO and that they should have required Musk to work full-time at Tesla instead of allowing him to focus on side projects, like SpaceX and X.Kristin Hull, founder of Tesla investor Nia Impact Capital, described the board as beholden to Musk, a problem she said is common at other big technology companies. ""This is the bro-show,"" she said of the situation.The pay package granted stock option awards for approximately 304 million shares that Musk can buy at about $23.33 each, well below $191.59 where it closed on Tuesday. Musk earned all 12 tranches of stock option awards as Tesla hit escalating financial and operational goals.Musk has not exercised any of the options and once he does he is required to hold the shares for five years before selling, according to McCormick.He was not guaranteed any salary.Tesla's value ballooned to briefly top $1 trillion in 2021 from $50 billion when the package was negotiated.Amit Batish at Equilar, an executive pay research firm, estimated in 2022 that Musk's package was around six times larger than the combined pay of the 200 highest-paid executives in 2021.Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Noel Randwich and Hyun Joo Jin in San Francisco, Jody Godoy in New York and Kanishka Singh, Eric Beech and Dan Whitcomb in Washington; Ross Kerber in Boston; Editing by Anna Driver and Jamie FreedOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabPurchase Licensing RightsTom HalsThomson ReutersTom Hals is an award-winning reporter with 25 years of experience working in Asia, Europe and the United States.

The bones were determined to be up to 47,500 years old. Until now, the oldest Homo sapiens remains from northern central and northwestern Europe were about 40,000 years old.""These fragments are directly dated by radiocarbon and yielded well preserved DNA of Homo sapiens,"" said paleoanthropologist and research leader Jean-Jacques Hublin of Collège de France in Paris.Homo sapiens arose in Africa more than 300,000 years ago, later trekking worldwide and encountering other human populations, including Neanderthals. The spotty fossil record has left unclear the details of how Homo sapiens spread through Europe and what role our species played in the extinction of Neanderthals, who disappeared roughly 40,000 years ago.Advertisement · Scroll to continueThe research, presented in three studies published in the journals Nature , opens new tab and Nature Ecology & Evolution , opens new tab , showed that the region was colder then than now - a chilly steppe-tundra setting akin to today's Siberia or Scandinavia - illustrating how Homo sapiens, despite roots in warmer Africa, adapted relatively quickly to frigid conditions.Nature , opens new tabNature Ecology & Evolution , opens new tabThe researchers concluded that small, mobile bands of hunter-gatherers used the cave sporadically as they roamed a landscape teeming with Ice Age mammals, and that at other times it was occupied by cave hyenas and cave bears.Advertisement · Scroll to continue""The site in Ranis was occupied during several short-term stays, and not as a huge camp site,"" said archaeologist Marcel Weiss of Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg in Germany, another of the research leaders.Bones and stone artifacts from the cave showed that these people hunted large mammals including reindeer, horses, bison and woolly rhinoceroses.""It is interesting that the diet of both these early Homo sapiens and late Neanderthals appears to be focused on large terrestrial game, which could have led to areas of competition,"" said zooarchaeologist Geoff Smith of the University of Kent, who led one of the studies. ""However, we still need additional data points to more fully understand the role and impact of climate and incoming Homo sapiens groups in the eventual extinction of Neanderthals in Europe.""Advertisement · Scroll to continueThe research appeared to resolve a debate over who made a specific set of European stone artifacts - attributed to what is called the Lincombian-Ranisian-Jerzmanowician (LRJ) culture - including leaf-shaped stone blades useful as spear tips for hunting. Many experts had hypothesized these were fashioned by Neanderthals. Their presence at Ranis with no evidence of Neanderthals instead indicates they were made by Homo sapiens.Advertisement · Scroll to continue""These blade points have been found from Poland and Czechia, over Germany and Belgium, into the British Isles, and we can now assume they most likely represent an early presence of Homo sapiens all over this northern region,"" Smith said.The researchers identified the bones based on mitochondrial DNA, which reflects maternal heredity. More can be learned through nuclear DNA, offering genetic information from both parents, including perhaps whether Homo sapiens at Ranis interbred with Neanderthals.The cave was excavated in the 1930s, with bones and stone artifacts found, before World War Two interrupted the work. Technology at the time could not identify the bones. Researchers re-excavated it from 2016 to 2022, uncovering more bones and artifacts. DNA sequencing on newly found and previously unearthed bones identified Homo sapiens remains.""The results for Ranis are amazing,"" Weiss said, adding that scientists should return to other European sites from this time period to check for similar evidence of an early Homo sapiens presence.Reporting by Will Dunham in Washington, Editing by Rosalba O'BrienOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabPurchase Licensing Rights"

https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/times-pe-vc-transactions-are-a-changin-2024-challenges-employment-ai-2024-01-31/,The times for PE and VC transactions are a-changin': 2024 challenges in employment and AI,By Lori Smith and Evan Poulgrain,"January 31, 2024",L,"January 31, 2024 - The first article , opens new tab in this two-part series (“The times for private equity and venture capital transactions are a-changin’: 2024 challenges,” Reuters, Dec. 19, 2023,) explored the impact of the Corporate Transparency Act's new reporting requirements and increased antitrust enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and U.S. Department of Justice on private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) funds. Read on for more key items that should be on the radar of PE and VC funds and their portfolio companies for 2024 and beyond, including changes in the law relating to enforceability of restrictive covenants and legal issues surrounding artificial intelligence.article , opens new tabEmployee restrictive covenants get their own restrictionsIn January, the FTC issued a proposal , opens new tab that would ban substantially all noncompetition agreements for employees. The FTC received an onslaught of comments on the draft rules and is expected to vote on a final version of the proposal in spring 2024, with likely courtroom challenges to follow. Earlier this year, the FTC , opens new tab also issued complaints against three employers alleging they violated antitrust laws in the manner in which they utilized employee noncompetition agreements.proposal , opens new tabFTC , opens new tabAdvertisement · Scroll to continueThese efforts are in addition to the FTC's position against no-poaching agreements between corporate entities seeking to restrict mobility of employees among competitors. The National Labor Relations Board's general counsel has also indicated her position that noncompetition agreements may unlawfully interfere with employee rights under the National Labor Relations Act.These developments are significant for the VC and PE industry since many of the companies backed by PE and VC investors are dependent on their intellectual property and proprietary business models and have routinely used noncompetition agreements as a method to protect their business from competition.Advertisement · Scroll to continueIn light of these developments, these companies and their PE and VC investors need to consider other avenues for controlling access to highly sensitive information, including strengthening their confidentiality and trade secret protections and utilizing more traditional methods for intellectual property protection such as copyrights and patents. PE and VC investors will want to adjust their diligence procedures for review of such restrictions and implementation of appropriate controls and protections to ensure they preserve the goodwill and value of the businesses in which they invest.Advertisement · Scroll to continueIn addition, over the last several years, we have seen a proliferation of states adopting laws restricting the use of noncompetition agreements for lower-wage or other specified categories of workers, or imposing other requirements such as advance notice or significant additional consideration. It is also no longer a given that noncompetition agreements will be more easily enforced in the context of an M&A transaction or that a court will correct an overly broad covenant rather than refusing to enforce it completely as evidenced by state court decisions striking down M&A-related noncompetition agreements deemed overbroad in scope.Advertisement · Scroll to continuePE and VC firms and their portfolio companies should remain mindful of these evolving restrictions. It is imperative to consider the current state of federal and state law when drafting noncompetition and non-solicitation restrictions, including in the context of investment and acquisition documents in M&A deals. Tax advisers should also be consulted in connection with the allocation of transaction consideration to deal-related noncompetition restrictions.Use of artificial intelligence raising numerous legal issuesWhile artificial intelligence (AI) can be a highly useful tool to create efficiencies and quickly sort and analyze data at speeds far in excess of anything that could be accomplished by a person, AI is also creating legal havoc. It has raised numerous legal issues across the spectrum, and the law is rapidly trying to catch up to protect individuals, workers, innovators, data owners, artists, entertainers, and brand owners, among others.PE and VC funds investing in or acquiring companies building AI tools or using AI in their business models or operations will need to do increased due diligence to keep apprised of issues resulting from the ever-evolving legal landscape in terms of compliance and governance practices and controls. These funds must ensure that companies in which they hold, or intend to acquire, an interest are implementing adequate controls and policies so as to protect the value of their assets.On Oct. 30, President Biden announced an executive order , opens new tab that takes a wide-ranging approach to analyzing and addressing the concerns raised by the use of AI, and that applies to companies that develop or use AI or AI-driven products or services and to consumers of those services. The order will impose new U.S. Department of Commerce reporting requirements for private companies that use high-powered AI algorithms and computing clusters in areas that could impact national security, which may include a broad range of tasks such as AI systems that are learning to deceive humans to evade their control.executive order , opens new tabUnsurprisingly, the order also looks at the intellectual property issues inherent in the use of AI — especially generative AI — that have been the subject of much discussion and consternation over the last year or so. These issues, most recently illustrated by the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strikes, have impacted artwork, entertainment, content creation and brand protection. The order includes express requirements for the Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and the director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to provide guidance regarding patent and copyright protection available to AI-related works, including those that have been created with contributions from generative AI.As these are evolving areas of law, VC and PE funds that either use AI in their operations or invest in companies that are developing or utilizing AI tools must do a thorough review of all such use of AI, with a particular focus on the data used for training AI tools to confirm compliance with applicable laws. Funds should exercise diligence and oversight of these areas going forward to ensure that neither such funds nor the companies in which they invest are violating third-party rights and have unfettered ownership of their assets developed through the use of AI.Firms should consider increased diligence efforts, including engaging counsel and consultants with a deep understanding of these issues to help navigate these novel issues and the ever-changing legal regulatory and litigation landscape.VC and PE firms should work with their counsel to review and revise the documentation they use when investing in or acquiring new entities as many of these are outdated and need to address the changing legal landscape by modifying the representations and warranties and covenants of their investment documentation to fully address the above issues.As part of their diligence review, buyers will need to satisfy themselves that sellers have all licenses and permissions required to utilize such AI technology in the way it is currently being used by the business and will adopt adequate policies and procedures to ensure ongoing compliance with the changing laws and protections for third-party rights. This is particularly important if AI technology is being used to generate new intellectual property for the target company.For example, if a target company is using AI tools to generate new software code, a buyer will need to be certain that: (a) the code being developed is owned by the target company and (b) the code being generated is not existing (and protected) intellectual property that the AI tool has simply repurposed. The law regarding intellectual property ownership of AI-generated content is still evolving, and VC and PE firms need to stay on top of new developments as they unfold.Finally, the use of AI tools in PE and VC investment decision-making is a double-sided coin that funds need to approach with caution. Potentially, AI could revolutionize the way funds identify potential investment opportunities, with the potential for faster, more accurate analysis. Currently, funds rely on human analysis to identify potential acquisition targets, and this process is invariably fraught with human error and potential bias.However, it remains vital that PE and VC funds utilizing AI tools in decision-making do not simply replicate the existing system. ""Algorithmic bias"" may occur if algorithms used by funds to analyze potential investment opportunities are erroneously trained to replicate the same inherent human biases present in the current system. PE and VC funds that utilize these tools need to ensure that the algorithms underpinning any such analysis are trained and audited using unbiased data and that there is always a human element to the review process.Moving forwardThese are just some of the legal and compliance issues that should be top-of-mind in 2024 for VC and PE investors and their portfolio companies. There are many other issues that will need to be considered such as evolving environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards; the increased adoption of state (and potentially federal) privacy laws such as the Utah Consumer Privacy Act that went into effect Dec. 31, 2023, and Delaware's adoption of its Personal Data Privacy Act in September 2023; and other laws that try to address new and innovative technologies, especially in the digital asset, cryptocurrency, biotech, and healthtech spaces.All of the above will require a change in the level and scope of due diligence and reexamining the documentation used in investments, as well as more vigilance in oversight by PE and VC fund designees on boards of directors of portfolio companies.Opinions expressed are those of the author.

Yet, unlike the clumsy sorcerer, AI wields real power, raising a critical legal question: can we truly trust what we cannot see?Advertisement · Scroll to continueThis opacity, often referred to as the ""Black Box"" dilemma, presents a challenge for the financial services industry, where transparency is crucial. Industry leaders have taken note. JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon highlights the need for AI systems to be explainable, meaning they should not only make decisions but also clearly justify them. For example, an explainable AI in credit scoring could transparently outline the reasons for approving or denying a loan.

In regions where data is scarce or guarded by restrictive licensing, AI development risks becoming a Black Box—opaque and inaccessible to external scrutiny. This lack of transparency can exacerbate secrecy in AI algorithms, making it difficult to understand, challenge or improve upon their decisions. The situation highlights a critical junction in AI development: unaccountable AI systems could have far-reaching consequences for society at large.The opacity of AI algorithms and data imbalances pose additional hurdles, potentially obscuring decision-making and perpetuating biases. For example, AI-driven trading algorithms could trigger market fluctuations with just one unclear decision, challenging regulators to maintain accountability and implement preventive strategies. Similarly, credit scoring systems illustrate the difficulties in regulatory oversight due to a lack of transparency, with the risk of entrenching biases from historical data.These challenges are compounded by the interplay of algorithmic and human biases, making it difficult to assign responsibility for biased outcomes. AI's potential to inadvertently reinforce discriminatory practices, such as redlining or targeting vulnerable groups with unsuitable products, raises significant concerns.In the financial sector, these biases can influence a broad spectrum of decisions, highlighting the critical need to balance AI's benefits against the risks of bias and discrimination.Yet regulatory bodies are scrambling to keep pace. In February 2023, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) censured , opens new tab Amigo Loans for insufficient affordability checks, influenced by a flawed algorithm, which put vulnerable customers at risk and resulted in unaffordable loans. The FCA eschewed a £72.9 million fine, considering Amigo's financial hardship and the impact on a High Court-mandated customer redress program.

Regulatory bodies like the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau offer guidance , opens new tab and oversight to ensure compliance under the FCRA in the digital age.guidance , opens new tabTowards comprehensive legal solutions and international frameworksTraditional legal and regulatory frameworks, built around human decision-making, face challenges when confronted with AI's Black Box nature. This dilemma, where the rationale behind AI decisions is not transparent or easily understandable, complicates the assignment of liability and responsibility, especially when such decisions lead to adverse outcomes or systemic risks.Global AI legislation and guidelines are increasingly focusing on critical aspects such as transparency, bias, accountability and systemic risk to build a resilient financial ecosystem that leverages AI's benefits while addressing its potential challenges. At the forefront of these efforts is the European Union's AI Act , opens new tab aimed at regulating the opacity of AI systems, especially within the financial sector.AI Act , opens new tabThis act, expected to receive final Parliamentary approval in April 2024, sets a comprehensive legal standard for tackling the risks associated with high-stakes AI applications, promoting ethical AI practices and enhancing overall system transparency and accountability.It introduces a pyramid framework for AI governance, focusing on risk-based classification, rigorous transparency requirements and human intervention to maintain the accountability of AI systems. This legislative structure is designed to demystify AI decision-making processes, ensuring that advancements in AI are in harmony with societal values.The U.S. is steering towards responsible AI through industry-driven initiatives and voluntary adherence, guided by the comprehensive Executive Order , opens new tab issued by the Biden administration in October 2023, which advocates for transparency without enforcing stringent regulations.Executive Order , opens new tabMeanwhile, the UK, in its July 2023 white paper , opens new tab champions a delicate equilibrium between fostering innovation and managing risk.

This framework emphasizes transparency over secrecy. Put simply, a Glass Box world champions openness and accountability, while a Black Box world cloaks the decision-making process in secrecy. This shift will be driven by advancements in Explainable AI (XAI), blockchain and quantum computing, each playing a pivotal role in redefining the contours of financial services and ethical governance, ultimately leading us towards a future where technology and transparency go hand in hand.XAI advocates for AI systems that elucidate their reasoning processes, promoting a deeper understanding and trust in AI decisions. In parallel, blockchain technology, particularly its public variant, has the potential to introduce an unprecedented level of transparency in financial transactions. By securing transaction records in an immutable ledger, blockchain could fortify trust and streamline regulatory compliance.Quantum computing, with its potential to dramatically enhance AI's analytical power, brings forth ethical considerations around data privacy and security. Despite these concerns, its unparalleled processing capabilities promise to revolutionize fields such as health care, climate science and finance, offering solutions to some of society's most complex problems.Accountability matters. As we navigate the complexities of AI integration in finance, lessons from the past urge us to build a future where innovation is balanced with human insight. By embracing new technologies, adopting comprehensive legal frameworks and fostering international cooperation, we can ensure AI-driven finance breaks new ground in innovation and paves the way for a resilient and prosperous future.Opinions expressed are those of the author.

Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says a quarter of the population - 576,000 people - are one step from famine.The U.S. airdrop used C-130 transport aircraft which dropped more than 38,000 meals along Gaza's Mediterranean coastline, the U.S. military said in a statement. Jordanian forces also took part in the operation.""We are conducting planning for potential follow-on airborne aid delivery missions,"" the statement said.A senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the drop had not been coordinated with any groups on the ground in Gaza but U.S. officials had seen civilians approaching the aid and distributing it among themselves.Advertisement · Scroll to continue""We've been monitoring the location where the assistance was dropped,"" the official said.A second U.S. official told Reuters the airdrops took place over southwestern Gaza and the town of Mawasi.The White House said on Friday the airdrops will be a sustained effort, and that Israel supported the measure.sustained effortUnder pressure at home and abroad, the Biden administration is also considering shipping aid by sea from Cyprus, some 210 nautical miles off Gaza's coast, according to a U.S. official.shipping aid by seaAdvertisement · Scroll to continueThe U.S. for months has been calling for Israel to allow more aid into Gaza, something Israel has resisted.Some experts said being forced to resort to costly, inefficient airdrops was the latest demonstration of Washington's limited influence over Israel as it pursues its war with Hamas. Washington is arming Israel and considers it one of its closest allies in the region.Critics of airdrops say they have only a limited impact on the suffering, and that it is nearly impossible to ensure supplies do not end up in the hands of militants.Advertisement · Scroll to continueAnother U.S. official said distributing aid has been a significant challenge in Gaza because lawlessness has escalated, with criminal gangs taking aid and reselling it.""There's a way that you resolve this problem. And the way is you flood the market. You bring in assistance from every point you can - air, sea, land,"" the official told reporters. ""The president's intent is to see that flooding of the zone.""Advertisement · Scroll to continueBefore the conflict, Gaza relied on 500 trucks with supplies entering daily.The U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA said on Friday that during February an average of nearly 97 trucks were able to enter Gaza each day, compared with about 150 a day in January.Deliveries through the Rafah Crossing between Egypt and Gaza have been almost halted. While trucks have sometimes passed through Israel's Kerem Shalom crossing, they have been disrupted by Israeli protesters seeking to block deliveries. UNRWA says the crossing was closed from Feb. 8-10 and Feb. 15-17.With people eating animal feed to survive and medics saying children are dying from malnutrition and dehydration, the U.N. has said it faces ""overwhelming obstacles"" getting in aid.Gaza health authorities said Israeli forces killed more than 100 people trying to reach a relief convoy near Gaza City on Thursday. Palestinians face an increasingly desperate situation nearly five months into the war.Israel blamed most of the deaths on crowds that swarmed around aid trucks, saying victims had been trampled or run over. An Israeli official also said troops had ""in a limited response"" later fired on crowds they felt had posed a threat.Israel says it is committed to improving the humanitarian situation in Gaza, and accuses Hamas militants of endangering Palestinian civilians by using them as human shields.Thursday's incident near Gaza City was the biggest loss of civilian lives in weeks. Hamas said it could jeopardize talks in Qatar aimed at securing a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages.

The details of that review, which will have a particular impact on mining, will be released in the next few months, Wilkinson said.Canada's deep experience with nuclear means it can ""leverage its experience and its technology to create jobs and economic opportunity,"" Wilkinson added.($1 = 1.3573 Canadian dollars)Reporting by Steve Scherer and Rod Nickel, additional reporting by Nia Williams Editing by Denny Thomas, Nick Zieminski and Diane CraftOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabPurchase Licensing RightsRod NickelThomson ReutersCovers energy, agriculture and politics in Western Canada with the energy transition a key area of focus.

You can see as much from the brief , opens new tab OpenAI filed this week in a copyright infringement case brought by The New York Times. OpenAI’s lawyers at Morrison & Foerster called for the case to be tossed, arguing that fair use principles will ultimately vindicate AI training with copyrighted materials because “it is perfectly lawful to use copyrighted content as part of a technological process that (as here) results in the creation of new, different, and innovative products.”has reportedbrief , opens new tabAdvertisement · Scroll to continueOr, as OpenAI argued flatly in a 2023 motion , opens new tab to dismiss most of a San Francisco federal court case by authors including the comedian and actress Sarah Silverman: “Fair use is not infringement.”2023 motion , opens new tabBy claiming DMCA violations rather than traditional infringement, The Intercept and Raw Story likely won’t face those arguments, according to their counsel. “We believe the fair use defense would not apply to our cases,” said plaintiffs' lawyer Jon Loevy.Advertisement · Scroll to continueThat's the good news for Loevy and his clients. The bad news: OpenAI and other defendants have lots of other arguments to combat DMCA allegations.Neither OpenAI nor Morrison & Foerster responded to my query about the latest lawsuits, which were filed in Manhattan federal court. Microsoft (MSFT.O) , opens new tab , which is named as defendant in The Intercept’s complaint, also did not respond to a request for comment. But, as I’ll explain, OpenAI and other artificial intelligence developers have previously addressed DMCA allegations in other cases – and have persuaded judges in two California suits to curtail the claims.(MSFT.O) , opens new tabThe Intercept and Raw Story, it turns out, are not the only plaintiffs to assert DMCA claims against AI developers, although they appear to be the first to allege only DMCA violations. The New York Times, the authors who sued OpenAI in San Francisco federal court, and three artists who sued image generator Stability AI all included DMCA allegations in their lawsuits, albeit as secondary to their copyright infringement claims. (Interestingly, a separate group of authors who sued OpenAI in Manhattan federal court did not bring DMCA claims in their Feb. 5 consolidated complaint , opens new tab .)consolidated complaint , opens new tabAI defendants have primarily argued in motions to dismiss DMCA claims that plaintiffs cannot show AI developers deliberately stripped copyright-identifying information from the content that trained their models. The statute requires plaintiffs to prove that defendants intentionally deleted identifying information in order to make it harder for copyright holders to track infringement. (The classic example is an internet site that crops a photographer’s name and copyright from a misappropriated image.) OpenAI and other defendants contend they did not use such subterfuge in their training models.They’ve also argued that plaintiffs can’t show they intended to omit copyright-identifying information from their output. In this week’s motion to dismiss The New York Times suit, for instance, OpenAI said ChatGPT, at worst, reproduces excerpts or snippets from Times stories. It does not reproduce entire stories shorn only of identifying copyright information, OpenAI said – which is the conduct Congress had in mind when it enacted the DMCA.Out of curiosity, I asked ChatGPT to write a brief moving for the dismissal of DMCA claims. The chatbot larded its response with warnings that it could not provide legal advice but suggested arguments that plaintiffs did ""not provide specific details regarding the alleged removal"" of copyright-identifying information and that any removal of such information ""was unintentional and without malice.""OpenAI noted in its dismissal brief in the Times case that two federal judges have already endorsed AI defendants’ DMCA arguments. Last October, U.S. District Judge William Orrick of San Francisco ruled , opens new tab that the artists who sued Stability AI failed to allege the removal of copyright identifying information from any specific works used to train the AI model. It was not enough, Orrick said, to claim wholesale alteration of images to delete information such as watermarks and artists' signatures. Plaintiffs, he said, had to allege specific alterations of particular works.ruled , opens new tabSimilarly, U.S. District Judge Araceli Martinez-Olguin of San Francisco dismissed , opens new tab authors’ DMCA claims against OpenAI earlier this month, holding that plaintiffs failed to show that defendants systematically deleted copyright-identifying information from training content.dismissed , opens new tabMartinez-Olguin said the premise was undermined by ChatGPT’s output, which included references to authors’ names and book titles. The judge also said it was significant, in the context of DMCA claims, that the authors’ books were not reproduced in full in ChatGPT responses.Journalists who claim that ChatGPT essentially plagiarizes their work in its entirety presumably won’t have that problem, but precedent suggests The Intercept and Raw Story will have to come up with plausible allegations that OpenAI removed or altered information from training content specifically to hide its reliance on copyrighted material.That won’t be easy.Read more:OpenAI says New York Times 'hacked' ChatGPT to build copyright lawsuitOpenAI says New York Times 'hacked' ChatGPT to build copyright lawsuitOpenAI hit with new lawsuits from news outlets over AI trainingOpenAI hit with new lawsuits from news outlets over AI trainingHow copyright law could threaten the AI industry in 2024How copyright law could threaten the AI industry in 2024Jumpstart your morning with top legal news delivered straight to your inbox from The Daily Docket , opens new tab .The Daily Docket , opens new tabReporting By Alison FrankelOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabOpinions expressed are those of the author.

These risks include the cost of remediation to water and soil, as well as healthcare costs. “The people most exposed are the communities surrounding chemical plants, which are often poor and non-white, so it is an equity and social justice issue as well as everything else,” she says.

Have producers taken into consideration the possible liabilities and legal action from plastic production? I believe this will eventually become uninsurable.” She adds that the liability costs could rival those in tobacco and asbestos, yet “there is no evidence at the moment that most chemical companies are prepared for this transition.Gorte agrees, noting that: “Chemical production facilities are very capital-intensive and making more sustainable products might involve changing the entire production process. As a result, there is a tendency to make new facilities and products safer, but there is a limit to how far they will go with existing product lines.”Such a stance might be difficult for the industry to maintain. In September the U.N. agreed the Global Framework on Chemicals , opens new tab , with a roadmap to phase out the most harmful chemicals in products.

PFAS chemicals are found in all sorts of products, from dental floss to toilet paper, frying pans to firefighting protective clothing and foam.3M, one of the biggest companies in the U.S., developed the firefighting foam in the 1960s. It announced in December 2022 that it would phase out the production of PFAS products by the end of 2025.

As regulations and customer expectations evolve, we see an opportunity to lead to make the greatest impact for those we serve.”Action on PFAS is “one of the best examples of where investor pressure has had an impact”, Witkowsky says.Dead fish are seen in a heavily polluted lagoon in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Are they aware of the exposure of individual facilities and the overall footprint of the corporations they are funding?”That doesn’t make it easy, though. Mariana Villanueva, ESG Analyst at AXA Investment Management points to the lack of standardised public disclosure on exposure to hazardous chemicals, which also means that the health and environmental risks of the sector have been underestimated.And while some producers are trying to develop alternatives to hazardous chemicals, others are doubling down, arguing that PFAS are important for the energy transition in sectors such as electric vehicle batteries, wind turbines and solar panels.“Whether you look at the supply chains for microchips, wind turbines, battery materials for electric vehicle or medicines, all of them are heavily relying on chemistry and chemical products,” says Cefic’s Lemoine. “This means that undeniably, the chemical industry has a crucial role in creating a more sustainable world.”At the same time, the chemicals industry’s customers are demanding safer, purer products, in part driven by the availability of more accurate measurement technologies, says Paul Cowell, vice-president of innovation, brands and sustainability at Archroma, which produces chemicals for the textiles industry. “Every year, the tolerance of impurities decreases,” he says.Walmart, for example, has a sustainable chemistry programme that focuses on three pillars: improving transparency into product ingredients, advancing chemical formulations and using “sustainable chemistry” certifications. “To accelerate the reduction of chemicals of concern from product formulations, we ask our suppliers to reduce, restrict or eliminate certain priority chemicals from their products,” it says.Firefighters contain smoke in an aeroplane engine with foam – one of the many products containing PFAS - ‘forever’ chemicals.

Other corporate signatories to the project include Target, Whole Foods Market and a number of US healthcare providers.In the UK, the Royal Society of Chemistry has launched a “taskforce for sustainable PLFs , opens new tab ” or polymers in liquid formulations, which are used to stabilise products from shampoos and skincare creams to paint. “PLFs play a vital role in our lives,” the society says. “They are found in millions of everyday products, from the soap in our bathrooms to the paint on our walls.

The company is working with researchers from York and Nottingham universities to identify new monomers and design new polymers that are more biodegradable and have lower aquatic toxicity, says Ian Tooley, European director of research and technology.Gorte of Impax says there has been a wake-up call for many in the industry. “There is a realisation that the past and the future are different places,” says Gorte. “Making safer alternatives will be a strong value driver for the industry. As soon as reasonable alternatives become available, the costs come right down. We saw that with ozone-depleting chemicals. Decarbonisation, detoxification and circularity will be drivers for the foreseeable future.”Meanwhile, AI and machine learning could revolutionise the quest for more sustainable chemicals by speeding up the discovery of new materials and molecules, reducing the time to market and the expense of experimentation, says David Gunn, senior scientific software developer at Materials Nexus.“AI and machine learning are extremely good at inferring the properties of novel chemicals from their structures, measuring how effective they would be for the purpose they are designed for and how very small changes can make harmful substances safer,” he says.This article is part of the latest issue of The Ethical Corporation magazine, on the Climate-health nexus.

His fortune evaporated in November 2022, when FTX declared bankruptcy after a wave of customer withdrawals.Advertisement · Scroll to continueAt his month-long trial in Manhattan federal court, three former close associates testified that Bankman-Fried directed them to help loot FTX customer funds to plug losses at his Alameda Research hedge fund, even while presenting himself publicly as a responsible steward in the volatile cryptocurrency market.Prosecutors said Bankman-Fried also used customer funds to buy luxury real estate in the Bahamas and to donate to U.S. politicians who might support cryptocurrency-friendly regulations.Bankman-Fried testified that he did not realize how much Alameda owed to FTX until shortly before both failed.Mukasey acknowledged Bankman-Fried's case bore some similarities to that of Elizabeth Holmes, another young entrepreneur who was sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2022 for defrauding investors in her now-defunct blood-testing startup Theranos.But he said Holmes put patients at risk, and suggested Bankman-Fried had more in common with Michael Milken - a Wall Street financier in the 1980s known as the ""junk bond king"" who was released from prison after serving just two years of an initial 10-year sentence on fraud charges.""Given the same chance, Sam would dedicate his post-prison life to charitable works,"" Mukasey wrote.MOTHER SAYS SHE WOULD CHANGE PLACESBankman-Fried has been jailed at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center since August, when Kaplan revoked his bail after finding that he likely tampered with witnesses.In a letter to Kaplan, Bankman-Fried's psychiatrist George Lerner wrote that he is on the autism spectrum.

https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/intersection-open-source-web3-2024-02-28/,Intersection of open source and Web3,"By Stuart D. Levi, Alex Drylewski and Priya Matadar","February 28, 2024",S,"Law FirmsSkadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom LLPSkadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom LLPFollowFebruary 28, 2024 - Over the last few decades open source software has become ubiquitous, and is the foundation of numerous products and services. However, Web3 is likely the first sector to be built almost entirely on open source technology; indeed the use of open source software is a critical component of establishing the transparency and security necessary for users to trust an effective decentralized, blockchain-based network. In this article, we examine some of the key attributes of open source software.In contrast to the various forms of intellectual property, there is no legal definition of ""open source software,"" nor are there attributes of the software itself that make it open source. Rather, ""open source software"" refers to software that is made available under open source or ""free software"" licenses. Also, there is no formal definition or requirements for these licenses, and today there are over 2,000 of such licenses available.Advertisement · Scroll to continueHowever, as a general matter, these licenses make the human-readable source code of the software available to licensees, and grant the licensee broad rights to use, distribute and make derivative works of the software. While there is no restriction on charging a fee for open source software, given that the source code is widely available, and that downstream licensees can themselves freely redistribute the code, most open source software is available at no charge.Advertisement · Scroll to continueIt is important to note the fact that even though the source code is made available under a broad license, the original creators still own the copyright in the underlying work.The fact that the source code is available makes open source software particularly well-suited for blockchain-based projects since it allows users to review the code before trusting these decentralized systems. In addition, the transparency of the source code allows the community to highlight and fix bugs and to build on the work of predecessor projects.Advertisement · Scroll to continueThere are two main bodies that have acted as stewards of critical open source licenses adopted by the community: (i) the Free Software Foundation (""FSF"") and (ii) the Open Source Initiative. These two groups approach open source from different perspectives, and their respective licenses reflect this dichotomy.The FSF historically viewed open source (which it termed ""free software"") as maintaining the original ethos of software development; namely academics and hobbyists who shared source code and believed it should not be proprietary. The family of licenses offered by the FSF enshrines what it has labeled the four freedoms of free software (freedom to (i) run, (ii) study, (iii) distribute and (iv) modify the software available under the license).Advertisement · Scroll to continueThese licenses, known under the rubric of the General Public License (""GPL""), and often called ""copyleft"" license (to suggest it is the opposite of copyright) grant a broad and unrestricted license to the source code. However, in order to ensure that the source code remains free, the license also requires that any modified version of the code that is distributed is done so under a GPL-license or a license it deems compatible with the GPL.This requirement has caused concern among companies embedding open source in their proprietary code since it may not be clear whether their proprietary code could now be deemed a modified version of the GPL code that needs to be released under a GPL license; sometimes referred to as the ""infection"" issue. As a result, in recent years, there has been a backlash by companies against GPL with many not allowing GPL code into their environments.The open source licenses supported by the Open Source Initiative, such as the Apache license and MIT license, are generally simpler than the GPL, and many only require that the user include an attribution to the original creators and a disclaimer of liability protecting those creators.Importantly, these licenses — often called ""attribution licenses"" — do not impose the same requirement as the GPL-family of licenses that modified versions of the applicable code be licensed under any specific open source license terms. This has resulted in these types of licenses becoming more commonly used over the last number of years.In the Web3 space, the ""risk"" of the infection issue is often seen quite differently than in other sectors. Since, as noted, there is so little proprietary code in blockchain based systems, the issue of infection is generally not present. Moreover, many projects want to lean into those licenses, such as the GPL, that maximize open source protection.That said, some blockchain projects that are also seeking adoption of their technology by non-Web 3 entities (e.g., a traditional financial institution seeking to tokenize certain assets) have been concerned that offering their code under a GPL license will hamper such adoption. These projects will sometimes implement a dual licensing strategy in which the code is available under both a copyleft and an attribution open source license.Dual licensing has sparked debate within the open source community with some arguing that this approach suggests there is something ""wrong"" with the GPL license, and that this reflects prioritizing commercial interests over the principles of openness and community collaboration. Managing a dual licensing approach can also be complex since the project-licensor will not know under which license a licensee is operating.While the transparency offered by open source software offers many benefits within the Web3 community, it can be a challenge for projects seeking to gain a ""first to market"" advantage over potential competitors. By releasing the code of their project, companies run the risk that another project can simply and quickly copy their code and launch a similar offering.As a result, a new licensing model, the Business Source License (""BSL""), has emerged as a purported middle ground between open source and proprietary licenses. Under a BSL, the source code is made available, but its use is limited for a defined period of time to internal or testing purposes. A license is required for any commercial use.After this defined period, the BSL automatically converts to an open source license, ensuring eventual public use while giving developers a commercial head-start. The BSL has sparked considerable debate with many arguing that its commercial use restrictions deviate from the foundational principles of open source, potentially hindering collaboration and innovation in the open marketplace.In the decentralized landscape of Web3 and blockchain, open source software remains central to driving innovation and fostering collaboration. As these technologies continue to evolve, finding the right balance between transparency and sustainability will be crucial in shaping the future of digital ecosystems. Through thoughtful licensing strategies and community engagement, the Web3 communities can leverage the power of open source to build more dynamic and resilient systems for the future.Alex Drylewski is a regular contributing columnist on cryptocurrency and digital assets for Reuters Legal News and Westlaw Today.Opinions expressed are those of the author.

It is often legally sold and resold through data brokers who can then transfer it to foreign intelligence services, militaries, or companies controlled by foreign governments.To allay concerns that the new rules would unnecessarily hamper economic activity, certain types of data including corporate payroll and compliance are exempted, they added.Certain transactions such as cloud service, employment and investment agreements would also be permitted, subject to some security requirements such as encryption and anonymization.The order also directs the Department of Justice to give industry ample opportunity to comment before proposals take effect.Responding to Biden’s order, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also said Wednesday it would develop rules in 2024 to limit data brokers’ international sale of Americans’ personal data.The agency, which under credit reporting laws can regulate consumer data collection, cited research from Duke University showing the personal data of U.S. military personnel and veterans was available online for as little as 12 cents per record and was vulnerable to exploitation by hostile actors.Reporting by Alexandra Alper and Kanishka Singh; Additional reporting by Douglas Gillison; editing by Chris Sanders, Richard Chang and David GregorioOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabPurchase Licensing RightsKanishka SinghThomson ReutersKanishka Singh is a breaking news reporter for Reuters in Washington DC, who primarily covers US politics and national affairs in his current role.

But the SEC was forced to approve them last month after Grayscale Investments won a court challenge. A federal appeals court ruled that the SEC had not sufficiently detailed its reasoning for rejecting the products.court challengeThat decision encouraged 12 asset managers, including Grayscale, ProShares, VanEck, Invesco, Fidelity and Ark Investments to file applications to launch 25 next-generation cryptocurrency ETFs.Many are complex products that would use options to amplify bitcoin's volatility. Others would track the price of ether, the No. 2 cryptocurrency after bitcoin.Investors hope the new products will help drive crypto further into the mainstream.

VanEck's filing is first in line for a decision on May 23, while the deadline for Grayscale's ether application is June 18.The SEC has yet to engage substantively with issuers on the applications, but is expected to begin meetings next month, said two other people familiar with the matter. The agency has not yet disclosed meetings on the products in its public log.Asked about the spot ether ETF filings this month, Gensler told CNBC the SEC's five commissioners would review them. Both Democrat commissioners voted against the bitcoin ETFs, while the two Republicans voted for them. That means Gensler would likely have the deciding vote.The arguments Grayscale used to defeat the SEC in its bitcoin ETF suit could apply to the ether products because the circumstances are similar. But some regulatory experts and issuers said Gensler could argue ether is a different type of asset.The SEC has said bitcoin is a commodity, but has not made a determination on ether. Unlike bitcoin, ether is traded on a so-called ""proof-of-stake"" blockchain that allows users to earn yield in exchange for locking up tokens for a period of time.

This is a niche part of the financial services market, but one that is gaining in prominence even if what exactly it is isn’t yet clear.“More and more actors in the financial system and the real economy are waking up to the fact that there needs to be more definitional clarity around transition finance,” says Dan Firger, founder of Great Circle Capital Partners and former adviser to Michael Bloomberg. “To what are we transitioning and what is the pathway to which we are aligning ourselves? It helps if you know where you want to go, but it’s quite complicated. Are you trying to get to net zero, a 1.5-aligned portfolio, are you enabling a sector, an industry or an entire country? They all have different implications.Advertisement · Scroll to continue“And on top of all that, investors have to just get on with it, because we don’t have much time to do this,” he adds.“There has been a palpable shift to an acceptance that we cannot just ringfence the bad and leave it out of the tent”, says Marina Severinovsky, head of sustainability at Schroders North America. “The locations of COP28 and COP29 in oil states (UAE and Azerbaijan respectively) illustrates that.”Advertisement · Scroll to continueIn one sense, any investment that helps companies to cut carbon – such as investments in electric vehicles or renewable energy – can be seen as transition finance. But these sectors are increasingly part of the mainstream, with well understood risks and opportunities, and the term is more often reserved for harder-to-tackle areas such as steel, cement, agriculture, shipping and aviation.A container ship docked at Hamburg, Germany. Transition finance is generally aimed at hard-to-abate areas such as shipping. REUTERS/Christian Charisius Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tabPurchase Licensing Rights , opens new tabThe UK government says that “transition finance refers to financial products and services that support higher emitting companies and activities to decarbonise over time. These instruments are generally used by companies seeking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and should be part of a credible decarbonisation pathway that is consistent with global climate goals.”Advertisement · Scroll to continueHendrik du Toit, chief executive of asset manager Ninety One, says that “for us, transition finance is additional and focused finance made available to emitters or businesses to meet their net zero targets”.One of the challenges of expanding transition finance is that it involves the deliberate stranding of assets that the traditional economy and financial sector still see as financially viable. Another problem is that it requires investors that may have committed to decarbonise their portfolios to buy into or continue holding fossil fuel assets.Advertisement · Scroll to continueBy definition transition finance needs to follow where the emissions are today, says Jennifer Tsim, UK and Ireland head of Climate and Sustainability at Oliver Wyman. “The main metric financial institutions are measured on today from a net zero perspective is financed emissions. This may mean that even if a bank is financing a company which has an ambitious transition plan in place, such transition finance could lead to a short-medium term increase in financed emissions, which can look like they are performing badly against their commitments, even if in the longer term they are supporting real economy decarbonisation. This can disincentivise the flow of capital to high-emitting sectors which require investment in order to transition.”Part of the problem today is that transition finance as a category or asset class does not really exist and so transition projects are being viewed through the prism of sustainability – is this a zero-carbon project – into which they do not really fit. This trend is exacerbated by the growth in green taxonomies, which make it clearer what is and isn’t a green investment.But, says Kate Levick, associate director, Sustainable Finance at E3G and co-head of the UK’s Transition Plan Taskforce secretariat, “it is no good investors just selling off their high-carbon assets. It doesn’t help the overall transition.”Activists place washing machines in front of the Deutsche Bank headquarters to protest against greenwashing during Deutsche Bank AG Annual Shareholders Meeting in Frankfurt, Germany, in 2022.

REUTERS/Heiko Becker Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tabPurchase Licensing Rights , opens new tabSaying you’re not going to tackle the heavy emitters, you’re just going to do the green stuff, doesn’t work, says Firger. “The heavy emitters are part of the problem. If you’re on a diet, you can’t just count the salads you eat, you have to count the burgers, too – and try to eat less of them.”Banks are wary of being accused of greenwashing, agrees Callum Macpherson, head of commodities at Investec. “But we have to be pragmatic. It is possible to make the bad stuff better. If you are doing good, it should be recognised.”There is $200 trillion to $250 trillion of financing in the world, and spending less than 2% of that a year would enable the world to transition, du Toit says. “At a macro level, it’s really easy. But at a micro level, the political consequences of redirecting $4 trillion to $5 trillion a year are substantial.”If South Africa were to switch immediately from coal to renewables, for example, “all the jobs would switch from the heavily-populated and potentially politically unstable east of the country to the underpopulated west. No democratic leader can do that before having transition finance in place so they can address the social and just transition issues created by reducing emissions,” he adds. “Communities cannot go from brown to green overnight.”Du Toit says that a focus on “creating perfect regulatory regimes is leading to investors being called out for greenwashing”, which is stopping them from investing. “We need to work out a framework in which investors can credibly allocate capital to brown assets in order to green them.”The risk of greenwashing is a real one, however, “so investors should say to all their portfolio companies ‘you can’t run a credible company today if you don’t have a credible transition plan’"".A coal-fired station in South Africa - the fossil fuel industry is a big employer in the heavily populated east of the country. REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tabPurchase Licensing Rights , opens new tabA further barrier to the growth of transition finance is that “if a transition plan is good, the company will probably want to spend extra money now rather than in five to 10 years’ time because that will make it worth more when the market has fully woken up to these risks,” he continues.“Transition finance needs to come out of the shadows. There is no obvious place to look for examples of this being done at scale,” Firger points out.One factor that may help this is that the current G20 presidency is held by Brazil , opens new tab , which is giving high prominence to these issues through its Task Force for the Global Mobilization Against Climate Change , opens new tab , which aims to “articulate coordinated responses to the challenges of climate change”.G20 presidency is held by Brazil , opens new tabTask Force for the Global Mobilization Against Climate Change , opens new tabA number of banks are working on transition finance frameworks, including Barclays, while Standard Chartered published one in 2023 as part of plans to mobilise $300 billion in green and transition financing by 2030.Transition taxonomies are a natural next step from green taxonomies, to make it clearer what transition investments are and how they should work. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) launched the world’s first multi-sector transition taxonomy across eight key sectors: energy, industrial, carbon capture and sequestration, agriculture and forestry, construction and real estate, waste and circular economy, information and communications technology, transportation.It is likely that more such initiatives will follow. MAS is also developing transition credits that could help to finance projects, while multilateral institutions such as the Asian Development Bank are developing their own frameworks and structural roadmaps, says Levick.“The MDBs are also talking about country platforms, similar to the JETPs (Just Economic Transition Partnerships) developed to help countries such as South Africa and Indonesia wean themselves off coal,” she adds. These would help to avoid unintended consequences from shutting one high-carbon project only to see emissions increase elsewhere in the economy. “Investors would engage with the platform and the country would allocate the money in the best way for the economy as a whole to decarbonise.”There are also a growing number of tools companies and investors can call on, including sustainability-linked loans, green bonds and a nascent transition bonds sector. Despite the challenges, says Tsim, “this is an opportunity for banks to support their customers and clients by financing emissions reductions, rather than just reducing financed emissions on paper”.Opinions expressed are those of the author.

Wind has made up some of the shortfall but polluting coal plants still make up most output.Construction has not even started on the planned $2 billion 800 MW Noor Midelt I plant, which was meant to start operating this year, after the Energy Ministry and grid operator ONEE rejected the proposed CSP technology, the sources said.Advertisement · Scroll to continueState energy agency MASEN awarded the contract to develop Noor Midelt I in 2019 to a consortium led by EDF Renouvelables.It asked for the plant to have both photovoltaic (PV) technology, which is cheaper but has little ability to store power, and CSP, which is more expensive but continue powering the grid for hours after dark.However, after the contract was awarded ONEE and the Energy Ministry said they would only agree to buy the power if MASEN either abandoned CSP for PV or changed from thermal salt energy storage to batteries, the sources said.Advertisement · Scroll to continueMASEN and the grid eventually signed a power purchase agreement, but there are still discussions between MASEN and the development consortium over the technology specifications, the sources said.MASEN says the project was delayed due to the pandemic and is now in the final stage of development but it did not respond to a specific Reuters request for comment on the technology dispute.EDF Renouvelables said Morocco had decided to restart the development in 2022 with a mix of PV, CSP and battery storage. It said the project was ""at the final stage of development"" and all partners ""remain committed"".Advertisement · Scroll to continueThe Energy Ministry did not comment directly on the problems at Noor Midelt but it said it ""tries to be as technology agnostic"" as it can as long as costs, sustainability and security objectives are maintained to avoid undue risk.The World Bank and the European Investment Bank said their financing terms for the project remain valid as discussions continue between MASEN and the consortium. The World Bank said construction will take 30 months once negotiations end.Advertisement · Scroll to continueCSP PLANT DIFFICULTIESONEE cited problems at Noor Ouarzazate, Morocco's best-known solar complex, as the reason for wanting MASEN to change the technology at Noor Midelt, the sources said.Technological problems stopped all output at a 150 MW plant there for a year from summer 2021, said two of the sources.""Noor Ouarzazate helped put Morocco on the global map of large-scale renewable energy projects. But a closer look in terms of operation costs and maintenance issues show that the plant is rather a liability,"" said a source close to Noor Midelt I.""With hindsight, Ouarzazate served as a testing ground for an immature CSP technology,"" said another source.Morocco's economic, social, and environmental council recommended abandoning CSP altogether in a 2020 report due to its high cost compared to PV and wind. That report said MASEN was operating an $80 million a year deficit at the Noor Ouarzazate complex because it is selling power for less than the production cost.MASEN, which commissioned Noor Ouarzazate, said the plant had shown ""good performance in 2023 both on peak and off-peak hours"". It added that CSP technology was a solution that offers storage, helping address grid needs at peak hours.ACWA Power, the developer of Noor Ouarzazate, and grid operator ONEE did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.Reporting by Ahmed Eljechtimi, editing by Angus McDowall and David EvansOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabPurchase Licensing Rights"

Sherer and Amy M. Joseph,"February 26, 2024",J,"February 26, 2024 - Digital health has been squarely in the spotlight since the onset of the COVID-19 public health emergency, during which increased adoption of virtual care technology emerged as one of the most important public health ramifications of the pandemic. Heading into 2024, a gradual transition is underway, as the use of digital health tools becomes propelled less by need associated with a global pandemic, but rather by its capacity to increase access to high-quality care while limiting cost and increasing access to care and convenience for patients.It is clear that digital health will remain an important part of the American health care ecosystem moving forward. But, like any worthwhile innovation in health care delivery, digital health's emergence and continued growth are causing ripples across health care in both expected and surprising ways. This article outlines some of the legal and business trends involving digital health that expect to be most impactful to industry stakeholders in 2024.Advertisement · Scroll to continueArtificial intelligence solutions will prompt new thinkingThe use of tools driven by artificial intelligence (AI) is not a new development in health care. Clinical decision support tools like chatbots (remember IBM's Watson?) and AI-powered applications in medical imaging are powerful tools that clinicians have leveraged in patient care for years. What is different in today's AI frenzy fueled by the likes of Chat GPT and others is the perception in some corners that AI can actually perform autonomous decision making.Advertisement · Scroll to continueMedicine and other clinical professions are highly regulated in the United States. State-level medical and other health care professional boards are (and will continue) doubling down on the notion that AI tools can be leveraged for support, so long as there is actual intervention by a treating practitioner with ultimate responsibility for the treatment furnished. However, as industry continues to innovate and deploy new AI solutions into health care delivery, regulators will (and industry stakeholders, therefore, must) be wary of the line separating decision support from active decision making.Advertisement · Scroll to continueUnderstanding the immense potential for expanded AI utilization in health care, the federal government began laying the groundwork for meaningful regulation of AI tools in care delivery in 2023, which trend will very much continue in 2024. To date, both the Biden Administration and the Office of the National Coordinator of Health Information Technology within the Department of Health and Human Services have emphasized the urgency of implementing more oversight of AI solutions, including addressing key concerns such as the risk of unlawful discrimination and risks to individual data privacy rights.Advertisement · Scroll to continueThe importance of transparency in AI solutions has also been strongly emphasized, as additional transparency permits further vetting of solutions, which is in turn expected to generate confidence among practitioners and patients in the tools at issue. States are similarly taking action to regulate use of AI. While some regulatory oversight is already in place, it is anticipated that within the next year there will be a lot of activity in this space as lawmakers seek to strike a balance between promoting innovation and protecting against the potential risks.New clarity on Medicare telehealth services and virtual prescribing of controlled substances?One of the early pandemic-era changes that was most necessary to catalyze the growth of virtual care was the temporary abandonment of several longstanding federal limitations on the coverage and reimbursement of telehealth services.Some of the most significant restrictions waived during the pandemic require Medicare beneficiaries to be located in a brick and mortar health care facility located in a rural area (with limited exceptions) for telehealth services to be covered, and rules prohibiting clinicians to prescribe controlled substances without first examining the patient in-person, unless limited exceptions that have failed to keep pace with modern care delivery models are satisfied.The result of these waivers was an explosion in telehealth utilization. Among Medicare beneficiaries, telehealth utilization increased tenfold from 2019 to 2020 according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO).See GAO, Telehealth in the Pandemic — How Has it Changed Healthcare Delivery in Medicare and Medicaid? (Sept. 29, 2022). On the virtual prescribing side, innovative virtual delivery models that were previously impossible because of in-person examination requirements emerged in areas including behavioral health, gender-affirming care, and obesity medicine.After Congress declined to make permanent decisions regarding the future of these waivers during the pandemic, the end of calendar year 2024 was identified as the deadline by which Congress must determine whether these waivers will be codified into law, or discontinued. How Congress navigates this critical issue will be one of the most important developments for health care industry stakeholders in 2024.Joint ventures and other strategic affiliations with telehealth companiesVirtual care practices are significantly less restricted by geographic limitations than brick and mortar providers. As a result, virtual practices often succeed in focusing on highly specialized care and narrow use-cases in ways that traditional practices cannot; they can draw on resources from a larger geographic pool (such as by utilizing specialists with multi-state licensure that can offer the services to a broader patient population), and often their business model is reacting to identified gaps in in-person care delivery across the healthcare marketplace.Digital health practices in this mold are increasingly exploring opportunities for strategic affiliations. These affiliations sometimes include collaborations with other virtual care companies, to facilitate closer care coordination and care management of certain patient populations, when the companies offer complementary services from which the same patient population could benefit.For example, imagine that virtual care company A specializes in pediatric behavioral health services, and virtual care company B specializes in pediatric speech language pathology (SLP) services. Such companies might explore entering into a care coordination agreement (such as by establishing a value-based enterprise and availing themselves of a value-based safe harbor under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute). They may also enter a services agreement where one company contracts downstream with the other to expand its offerings to enterprise customers or individual patients by providing a more comprehensive solution. Or companies may otherwise consider a joint offering to customers.Similarly, as it becomes increasingly clear that telehealth is now part of any clinician's toolkit of health care delivery tools moving forward, brick-and-mortar stakeholders like hospitals and skilled nursing facilities are embracing telehealth. While some health systems in particular are developing their own telehealth practices and programs (which may utilize a third-party telehealth platform through which their clinicians deliver services), many are leveraging the tremendous learnings and technology developed by telehealth companies, as well as the affiliated clinician workforce, rather than reinventing the wheel. Some are going so far as to develop new joint venture telehealth service lines, as well, to further promote patient choice and increase access to care.Continued enforcement activityFor years, telehealth advocates have warned the provider community that increased utilization of telehealth services will yield greater scrutiny from regulators focused on weeding out bad actors. Throughout the pandemic this prediction rang true, with the Department of Justice, State Medicaid Fraud Control Units, and private payors each appearing to increase efforts to identify clinicians and practices submitting claims for services not rendered, upcoding to impermissibly increase reimbursement, and repurposing other illegal strategies commonplace in health care fraud schemes.Similarly, with the rise of various digital health solutions there has been an increased focus on patient privacy and security considerations virtual care models implicate at both the federal and state levels. For example, after taking issue with allegedly improper data tracking practices involving several sizable digital health companies (as well as other provider organizations), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (HHS OCR) issued a joint letter to approximately 130 telehealth companies and hospital systems in July 2023 warning them about risks associated with tracking technologies, including Meta pixel and Google Analytics under applicable privacy laws.In addition, following the adoption of the California Consumer Privacy Act, more states have since adopted comprehensive data protection laws, and this trend is expected to continue in 2024. While not specific to digital health, these developments are important for industry stakeholders to track, particularly given that many digital health solutions are facilitating the delivery of services to residents of multiple states.Non-physician practitioner trend continuesA consistent trend in health care delivery in recent years has been leveraging practitioners to practice at the ""top"" of one's license. In practical terms, this means building clinical workflows around non-physician practitioners with prescriptive authority — generally advanced practice nurses, also known as nurse practitioners in many states, and physician assistants — who can, in many cases, occupy roles traditionally occupied by physicians whose labor is more expensive.Perhaps the thorniest set of legal issues this trend involves is state-level requirements for collaborative practice and/or supervision. While the nature of virtual care allows for seamless care delivery across state lines, practitioners delivering that care have to navigate frameworks that simply were not designed with virtual care in mind.Some of the more common challenges we see involve states which require in-person meetings between a non-physician practitioner and their collaborating physician, as well as the need to receive supervision from a physician appropriately licensed in the state where the non-physician practitioner is practicing. Particularly in national delivery models in which heavily licensed practitioners treat patients across a range of states, the process of identifying each state's specific requirements and ensuring appropriate supervision is in place is no small task. This trend is likely to continue to grow as provider organizations struggle with clinician workforce shortages and reimbursement levels compared to the cost of delivering care.Opinions expressed are those of the author.

But they also indicated they might permit the laws to regulate certain non-expressive internet services such as the provision of email, direct messaging or car-sharing.The laws were challenged by tech industry trade groups NetChoice and the Computer & Communications Industry Association, whose members include Facebook parent Meta (META.O) , opens new tab , Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O) , opens new tab , which owns YouTube, as well as TikTok and Snapchat owner Snap (SNAP.N) , opens new tab .

Clement said that upholding the laws would be dangerous for young people - whose social media use is being increasingly scrutinized as harmful - because protective measures might be undermined.""If we have suicide prevention, we have to have suicide promotion to avoid viewpoint discrimination. That should be a non-starter,"" Clement said.Florida's law requires large platforms to ""host some speech that they might otherwise prefer not to host"" by prohibiting the censorship or banning of a political candidate or ""journalistic enterprise.""The Texas law forbids social media companies with at least 50 million monthly active users from acting to ""censor"" users based on ""viewpoint,"" and allows either users or the Texas attorney general to sue to enforce it.Florida is seeking to revive its law after the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled largely against it. The industry groups are appealing a decision by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upholding the Texas law.The Supreme Court's ruling is expected by the end of June.A decision upholding the laws could take a toll on social media companies' ability to attract advertiser dollars, said Debra Aho Williamson, a long-time analyst of Facebook-owner Meta.""Going into the 2024 election, U.S. advertisers are very concerned about brand safety in social media.

""The mission director has to make sure everyone does their job, and does their job perfectly, almost like a conductor.""Crain said the spacecraft, burning a propulsion fuel of liquid methane and liquid oxygen for the first time in space, ""performed flawlessly"" during its seven-day flight to and in orbit around the moon.The condition of Odysseus was murky immediately after its landing. It took some time after an anticipated radio blackout to re-establish communications with the spacecraft and determine its fate some 239,000 miles (384,000 km) from Earth.When contact was finally renewed, the signal was faint, confirming that the lander had touched down but leaving mission control immediately uncertain as to the precise condition and position of the vehicle, company officials said during a webcast of the event on Thursday evening.Crain said he believed that the payloads aboard the lander would be able to operate for about nine or 10 days, after which sun will have set on the polar landing site.Shares of Intuitive Machines tumbled 30% in extended trade on Friday, wiping out all their rally in Friday's market session after the company said its moon lander had tipped over.Intuitive Machines tumbledReporting by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles and Joey Roulette in Washington; Editing by Diane CraftOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tabPurchase Licensing Rights"

The spacecraft was not designed to provide live video of the landing, which came one day after it reached lunar orbit and a week after its launch from Florida.Thursday's landing represented the first controlled descent to the lunar surface by a U.S. spacecraft since Apollo 17 in 1972, when NASA's last crewed moon mission landed there with astronauts Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt.To date, spacecraft from just four other countries have ever landed on the moon - the former Soviet Union, China, India and, mostly recently, just last month, Japan. The United States is the only one ever to have sent humans to the lunar surface.Odysseus is carrying a suite of scientific instruments and technology demonstrations for NASA and several commercial customers designed to operate for seven days on solar energy before the sun sets over the polar landing site.The NASA payload focuses on space weather interactions with the moon's surface, radio astronomy and other aspects of the lunar environment for future landing missions.Odysseus was sent on its way to the moon last Thursday atop a Falcon 9 rocket launched by Elon Musk's company SpaceX from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.DAWN OF ARTEMISIts arrival marked the first ""soft landing"" on the moon ever by a commercially manufactured and operated vehicle and the first under NASA's Artemis lunar program, as the U.S. races to return astronauts to Earth's natural satellite before China lands its own crewed spacecraft there.NASA aims to land its first crewed Artemis in late 2026 as part of long-term, sustained lunar exploration and a stepping stone toward eventual human flights to Mars. The initiative focuses on the moon's south pole in part because a presumed bounty of frozen water exists there that can be used for life support and production of rocket fuel.A host of small landers like Odysseus are expected to pave the way under NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, designed to deliver instruments and hardware to the moon at lower costs than the U.S. space agency's traditional method of building and launching those vehicles itself.Leaning more heavily on smaller, less experienced private ventures comes with its own risks.Just last month the lunar lander of another firm, Astrobotic Technology, suffered a propulsion system leak on its way to the moon shortly after being placed in orbit on Jan. 8 by a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Vulcan rocket.placed in orbitThe malfunction of Astrobotic's Peregrine lander marked the third failure of a private company to achieve a lunar touchdown, following ill-fated efforts by companies from Israel and Japan.Although Odysseus is the latest star of NASA's CLPS program, the IM-1 flight is considered an Intuitive Machines mission.
